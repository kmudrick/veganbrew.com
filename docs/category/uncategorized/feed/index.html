					<description><![CDATA[Oaked Belgian Imperial Wheat Stout: say that three times!  Or just shorten it with "Allagash Odyssey Clone".

Odyssey happens to be my favorite non-sour from Allagash.  Essentially, it is a big stout, brewed with a healthy portion of wheat, fermented with belgian yeast, and aged in new American Oak barrels for some amount of time.  I highly recommend trying this beer - my first taste of it precluded the recent belgiany-stout rash that seems to be going around, so it will always be special to me.

A few years back Rob Todd, owner of Allagash, was at a "Meet The Brewer" type event at the South Philadelphia Taproom.  I kept gushing about how much I loved Odyssey, so after encouragement from my wife and prodding via text from Brett, I worked up the nerve to walk up to Mr Todd, tell him how much I loved Odyssey, and ask him how to brew it.

"I can't tell you that, it's secret! ... Just kidding" he began with.  He proceeded to give me an array of pointers which got me on the right track to brewing a similar beer.  It was an awesome experience, and Rob Todd is a straight up awesome dude.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oaked Belgian Imperial Wheat Stout: say that three times!  Or just shorten it with &#8220;Allagash Odyssey Clone&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.allagash.com/beer/specialty/odyssey">Odyssey</a> happens to be my favorite non-sour from Allagash.  Essentially, it is a big stout, brewed with a healthy portion of wheat, fermented with belgian yeast, and aged in new American Oak barrels for some amount of time.  I highly recommend trying this beer &#8211; my first taste of it precluded the recent belgiany-stout rash that seems to be going around, so it will always be special to me.</p>
<p>A few years back Rob Todd, owner of Allagash, was at a &#8220;Meet The Brewer&#8221; type event at the South Philadelphia Taproom.  I kept gushing about how much I loved Odyssey, so after encouragement from my wife and prodding via text from Brett, I worked up the nerve to walk up to Mr Todd, tell him how much I loved Odyssey, and ask him how to brew it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you that, it&#8217;s secret! &#8230; Just kidding&#8221; he began with.  He proceeded to give me an array of pointers which got me on the right track to brewing a similar beer.  It was an awesome experience, and Rob Todd is a straight up awesome dude.</p>
<p>My general notes from my conversation with Rob:</p>
<ul>
<li>A lot of cane sugar; cheap and easily fermentable to ensure dryness</li>
<li>Roughly approaching it like a stout in terms of proportions of roasted grains &#8211; but trying for a pretty even (40/60 or 50/50) ratio of wheat to 2-row/pale</li>
<li>Belgian Wheat (<strong><em>not</em></strong> wit) yeast strain that will give good phenolics &amp; mild spices while playing off the wheat, and being able to ferment a high gravity beer</li>
<li>Age a portion on <strong>New</strong> American Oak (American oak is more vanilla-y &amp; aggressive than French oak) and the rest in stainless (and then blend)</li>
</ul>
<p>Since this was going to be such a big beer (10+% ABV) and I had just used <a href="http://www.wyeastlab.com/hb_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=137">Wyeast 3942 Belgian Wheat</a>, I decided to dump the wort on top of the used yeast cake from my <a title="Belgian Mild" href="https://veganbrew.com/2009/12/30/belgian-mild/">Belgian Mild</a>.  I generally try to target 6 gallons at the end of the boil, getting 5.5 gallons into the fermentor on most of my beers, so this recipe reflects that.</p>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
<li>9lb US 2-Row (42%)</li>
<li>7lb 8oz white wheat malt (35%)</li>
<li>1lb roasted barley (5%)</li>
<li>8 oz Belgian debittered black malt (2%)</li>
<li>3.5 oz flaked barley (1%)</li>
<li>2 lbs sugar (9%)</li>
<li>1 lb light dried malt extract (because I missed gravity)</li>
<li>6 oz wheat malt extract (because I missed gravity)</li>
<li>Wyeast 3942 &#8211; Belgian Wheat</li>
<li>.7 oz Galena (14.1 AA%) at 60 minutes</li>
<li>.4oz Hallertau Hersbrucker (3.8 AA%) at 5 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>I had major efficiency issues with this batch.  I inadvertantly opened up the rollers on my grain mill too much, and ended up with a pre-boil gravity off by nearly 14 points!  To compensate, I added 6oz wheat DME and 1lb light DME and boosted the sugar to 2 pounds (from 1.5.)  The DME &amp; extra sugar helped close the gravity gap a bit &#8211; my OG ended up only being 4 points off (1.085.)  I fermented this batch at 68, using a chest freezer with a temperature regulator.  This strain has a range up to 74, but I really wanted to keep the phenolics to a minimum.</p>
<p>After 12 days fermenting (very vigorously, very quickly &#8211; I had to rely on a blowoff for this batch) I was down to 1.016.  At this point, I transferred into a corny keg and added the oak.  I used 2 oz of American Oak cubes from <a href="http://www.williamsbrewing.com/4_OZ_AMERICAN_OAK_CUBES_P2085.cfm">Williams Brewing</a> (Boiling in water for 15 minutes to sanitize.)  I aged this keg for 8 months at basement temperatures (for me, mid 60s in the winter), the final 2 being at 55 (back into the chest freezer.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/9-aAxRS11YezKOI5XwuN4r54h0U_F9LING2kAQ7nxYE?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh6.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TQGhM571GyI/AAAAAAAAAOI/6LR0W4htC8I/s400/IMG_0504.JPG" alt="" width="299" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/hCtcth6OHODO5KBaTOZaqL54h0U_F9LING2kAQ7nxYE?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh3.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TQGhOfFAOoI/AAAAAAAAAOM/vg-QiF8pzag/s400/IMG_0506.JPG" alt="" width="299" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The final verdict?  I loved this beer.  Rich mouthfeel, pleasant roastyness, excellent head retention.  Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t think it tasted very much like Odyssey &#8211; the phenolics in this beer were much more pronounced.  I actually think it tasted a lot like the Stone Belgo IRS (the last iteration &#8211; not the current one spiced with Anise, which I find to be quite vile.)  In hindsight, I wish I would have bottled the majority of this batch to make it last longer &#8211; it was too easy to pour off 6 oz at a time from the tap for tastes &#8220;just to make sure it still tasted right.&#8221;  I&#8217;ll definitely brew this again &#8211; hopefully hitting my gravity marks &#8211; though I might ferment it a few degrees cooler, using a big starter rather than a yeast cake, which I think would make it more Odyssey-esque.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the <a title="Vegan in LA!" href="https://veganbrew.com/2010/11/11/vegan-in-la/">Los Angeles Vegan Beer Fest</a>, I had the awesome opportunity to try <a href="http://seabirdstruck.com">Searbirds</a>&#8216; beer-battered avocado tacos.  As a lover of tacos, of beer, and of avocado &#8211; this was a moment of sheer joy.  As someone who enjoys cooking &#8211; this was inspiration to try to do something similar myself.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/piXOZo7VtcdvXU06gpn50ELnzu_bgPI1luBULyjbriM?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh5.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBXMQQPprI/AAAAAAAAAKY/EJuJLdwu7Jw/s400/IMG_0293.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Given that avocados, when cut up, are somewhat slippery, I figured I needed a &#8220;more grippy&#8221; batter.  Usually, for beer batter, I use Isa&#8217;s recipe from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vegan-Brunch-Homestyle-Asparagus/dp/0738212725">Vegan Brunch</a>.  For this, I decided to make the batter more putty-like, less batter-like &#8211; the idea being that I could take gobs of it and mold it around the avocado slices.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/b2dh3UI4VJJ3feTIqO2dk0Lnzu_bgPI1luBULyjbriM?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh6.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBXB0P6GRI/AAAAAAAAAKA/7WGW9T8MW8I/s400/IMG_0269.JPG" alt="" width="299" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Beer Batter Ingredients</p>
<ul>
<li>1/2 Cup Flour</li>
<li>1/2 Cup Bread Crumbs (I used <a href="http://www2.kelloggs.com/ProductDetail.aspx?id=39">Corn Flake Crumbs</a>)</li>
<li>1/2 Cup Sly Fox <a href="http://www.slyfoxbeer.com/index.php/front/beer_pils">Pikeland Pils</a></li>
<li>2/3 Cup Water</li>
<li>1 Tablespoon corn starch</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ZeFNFL7Sjpd3l75TOOCcZkLnzu_bgPI1luBULyjbriM?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh5.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBXDm-WY3I/AAAAAAAAAKE/fa95uxfy1oM/s400/IMG_0272.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/h2XMMJS_52RJT9w0cfeBEkLnzu_bgPI1luBULyjbriM?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh4.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBXFG4vOZI/AAAAAAAAAKI/hrn4KqX-C6s/s400/IMG_0276.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/LHDS1ZnTyGUeEF5fA_J16ELnzu_bgPI1luBULyjbriM?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh4.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBXHEz3OeI/AAAAAAAAAKM/uVSESLiimow/s400/IMG_0277.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I took clumps of the &#8220;batter&#8221; and molded it to wrap around each avocado slice. I then rolled them in a separate bowl of bread crumbs to get the final later of crispy outside.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/PNbs9U2WfzFJkNJLvjJdGkLnzu_bgPI1luBULyjbriM?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh3.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBXIVlBAgI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/SYU5WPW9XHE/s400/IMG_0279.JPG" alt="" width="299" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I don&#8217;t have a deep fryer, so I simply pour a thin layer of canola oil into a nonstick pot and fry in that.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/1zMJ0Q5stXcyDh5PkohHbELnzu_bgPI1luBULyjbriM?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh5.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBXKO8gZlI/AAAAAAAAAKU/OFX-YOC4xpc/s400/IMG_0284.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">That&#8217;s it.  Simple!  In the first picture, I topped one of the tacos with <a href="http://www.chefdrew.com/Pages/products/dressings/dressings.html">Drew&#8217;s Smoked Tomato Dressing</a> and another with some salsa, stacking the avocado slices on top of a bed of chopped romaine lettuce.  I think these turned out pretty awesome.  My only complaint is that I am somewhat poor at picking out ripe avocados, so some of the pieces were not as buttery soft as I would have liked.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I completely winged Thanksgiving this year &#8211; literally hitting Whole Foods at 9am to pick up a myriad of groceries to use.  In the back of my mind, I knew I wanted to do some sort of seitan/soy roast, some mashed potatoes, and stuffing.  Vegan stuffing &#8211; even though it seems such a simple thing to make &#8211; is annoying in that Whole Foods&#8217; bags of stuffing are all full of meat flavoring.  I could go to a local supermarket and pick up some nutritionally junky hydrogenated-oily stuffing cubes, but I decided to just make my own with bread, using <a href="http://elizaveganpage.blogspot.com/2010/11/classic-sage-and-onion-stuffing.html">this recipe</a> I came across this week.</p>
<p>Anyway, here are some pictures and whatnot:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/UtZ52lNBcmEPvcl1yB5pZm_JCVdRaKNnDTaU5HN7dks?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh5.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TO7U5lBk1qI/AAAAAAAAAMc/A_nPHgF7X8Y/s400/IMG_0368.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://elizaveganpage.blogspot.com/2010/11/classic-sage-and-onion-stuffing.html">Classic Sage &amp; Onion Stuffing</a>, from Elizavegan. I used a loaf of whole wheat bread from Whole Foods that was on sale for $2.  This turned out fracking <em>amazing</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">

<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://macandcheesereview.blogspot.com/2010/02/soy-and-seitan-roast.html">Soy &amp; Seitan Roast</a> from Mac &amp; Cheese.  I wrapped the roast in yuba skin for the last 30 minutes of baking.  The texture and taste is pretty similar to a cross between Tofurky and the now-defunct Unturkey.  I find the amount of chickpea flour used in this recipe to be a tad overwhelming flavor-wise; I&#8217;d probably cut it with some other high-protein flour (maybe soy flour) in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think most vegans and vegetarians pretty much universally like seitan.  I find some, however, to be surprised when you tell them how easy it is to make.  Seitan can be both cheap and easy to craft in your own kitchen!</p>
<p>I have fond memories of the &#8220;Singing Cowboy&#8221; from Veggie Works in Belmar, NJ.  The centerpiece of that dish were large, thin slabs of perfectly breaded and fried seitan.  Friday night I came home from work and was in the mood to make something similar; here&#8217;s the process I took to pull that off.</p>
<p>A few upfront notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>This method of baking, not boiling, and using a nut butter for a fat source that also helps make these cutlets easily moldable, was inspired &amp; heavily influenced by Susan&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.fatfreevegan.com/2007/05/barbecued-seitan-ribz.html">Barbecued Seitan Ribz</a> over at <a href="http://blog.fatfreevegan.com/">FatFree Vegan Kitchen</a>.</li>
<li>I like using <a href="http://www2.kelloggs.com/ProductDetail.aspx?id=39">Corn Flake Crumbs</a> for the coating. I first tried these, I think, at <a href="http://www.foodswings.net">Foodswings</a> in Brooklyn several years ago.</li>
<li>I often use Trader Joe&#8217;s concentrated vegetable broth &#8211; they come in little  foil packets and are easy to drop into water, because I am pretty lazy.   The same product, non-TJ-labeled, can be found on Amazon.com <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Savory-Choice-Vegetable-Concentrate-4-2-Ounce/dp/B001E5E2B8/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1289773877&amp;sr=8-3">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 cup Vital Wheat Gluten</li>
<li>2 tablespoons nutritional yeast</li>
<li>3/4 cup vegetable broth</li>
<li>1 tablespoon tahini</li>
<li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/wrxFiGhF_ltONAlNDF8bmBGGSJWfjBTccV3ZS7P0hkY?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh4.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBZ_oEtXSI/AAAAAAAAALE/g-2Rm22ZYpA/s400/IMG_0261.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Combine the vital wheat gluten flour and the nutritional yeast</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/EjYecJ41e_I4b4e4kFd2rxGGSJWfjBTccV3ZS7P0hkY?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh5.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBiJNokcqI/AAAAAAAAALM/90Pof9jvmfc/s400/IMG_0260.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Step 2</strong>: Mix the broth, olive oil, and tahini. You could substitute another nut butter if you don&#8217;t have tahini.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/UTD6iM1dZIKCcT4GTy4ULRGGSJWfjBTccV3ZS7P0hkY?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh6.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBaDNv9NwI/AAAAAAAAALI/Z4zWli1iEvw/s400/IMG_0265.JPG" alt="" width="299" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Step 3</strong>: Mix the brothy mixture into the flour mixture.  Knead it a little bit with your hands briefly (around 30 seconds.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/4JrDzXRQJPa91LZ2S7n3-BGGSJWfjBTccV3ZS7P0hkY?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh5.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBXsBGMX7I/AAAAAAAAAKw/Hg3U56BFrYg/s400/IMG_0267.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Spray a glass dish with cooking spray.  Rip off chunks from the doughy mixture and flatten them out with your hands in the dish to the size and shape that you want. These aren&#8217;t going to shrink or expand much when cooking.  The pieces should be pretty easy to work with, and consistency-wise should feel more like something between paste and putty.  They will be somewhat fragile, but the baking will help firm this up.  Assuming your oven is up to temperature already, slide this in to begin baking.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/xHzT3pq3SLyAJyT7QUVT2xGGSJWfjBTccV3ZS7P0hkY?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/lh6.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBXzo63mYI/AAAAAAAAAK8/5WMzW2tveT4/s400/IMG_0281.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Step 5</strong>: After around 10 minutes, take them out to check on them. You want to be able to slide a spatula cleanly under them without the pieces sticking. This might take closer to 15 minutes, depending on your oven.  Flip the pieces over with a spatula.  The pieces should be glistening &#8211; not dry. If they look dry, add a little bit of broth (or some water with tamari or soy sauce.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/0dLkDSlWzPxLTsvCfImQZBGGSJWfjBTccV3ZS7P0hkY?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh3.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBXuI1GV9I/AAAAAAAAAK0/ZREHYbjljtE/s400/IMG_0273.JPG" alt="" width="299" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Step 6</strong>: After about 10 minutes, they should be ready. At this time you could sprinkle some seasonings on if you want.  I find thyme works well here.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">At this point, you could use them however you&#8217;d like &#8211; slice into strips for stir-fries, pile onto bread for a nice sandwich, or batter and fry them.  That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/pHnw4MGe9eblexsFY2QhDhGGSJWfjBTccV3ZS7P0hkY?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh4.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBXxhXVYDI/AAAAAAAAAK4/iuhmWoa5FJE/s400/IMG_0276.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong>: To batter these, I use a simple process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dip into a bowl of plain flour</li>
<li>Dip into a bowl of water</li>
<li>Transfer into bowl of bread crumbs, coating evenly</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong>: Fry them. I won&#8217;t go into details here; I usually fill a stockpot with some vegetable oil and just drop the pieces in, flipping them when they get golden-brown.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/8hQqtNvbAwzXz-uQehrpQRGGSJWfjBTccV3ZS7P0hkY?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh3.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBX1FNmcRI/AAAAAAAAALA/nb6QMPGOaIc/s400/IMG_0291.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Typically I&#8217;ll consume these with stuffing, or mashed potatoes and gravy.  Friday night I was hungry, so I just ate them as is on a plate, with a light sprinkling of truffle salt on top.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, somewhat on a short-scheduled whim, I decided to visit Los Angeles.  I&#8217;ve only been California once before in my life (San Francisco) and don&#8217;t travel too often. But I&#8217;ve been drooling over the pictures &amp; reviews that <a href="http://quarrygirl.com">quarrygirl</a> has been posting for a while now &#8211; and when she decided to put together a <strong><a href="http://losangelesvegan.com/">Vegan Beer Fest</a></strong> &#8211; complete with food &amp; bands, I found the perfect excuse for a trip.</p>
<p>I left work early last Thursday, catching an early evening flight from Philly which would put me in LA around 9. Upon arriving &amp; getting my rental car, I hit my trusty <a href="http://developer.palm.com/appredirect/?packageid=com.mudrick.veginout">HappyCow VeginOut Guide</a> app to see what was near the Airport and still open. VeggieGrill was the winner!  <em>Side note: I wrote the app, it is available for Palm webOS devices (Pre &amp; Pixi) and will use gps to find nearby veg eateries.</em></p>
<h2>Day 0: VeggieGrill</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.veggiegrill.com">VeggieGrill</a> is nothing sort of amazing.  An all-vegan fast food chain in California (4 locations with a 5th coming soon), the menu (affordable wraps, burgers, salads, soups) is precisely something we&#8217;re lacking here in Philly. The space is bright &amp; clean, the employees were super-friendly, and they also serve beer and wine.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Chill Out Wings by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5153870865/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4057/5153870865_a8be4e5268.jpg" alt="Chill Out Wings" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">First up, I had the Chill Out Wings. These are about a half-dozen seitan tenders in a slightly flakey batter, served with tangy BBQ sauce and a mild-tasting white sauce.  They reminded me somewhat of the Tender Tiger from <a href="http://www.verticaldiner.com">Vertical Diner</a> in Salt Lake City. I&#8217;m not a huge fan of ranch / vegenaise types of sauces (though they are growing on me, slowly) but the blend of these two sauces made for a very flavorful appetizer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="All American Stack by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5154473182/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4005/5154473182_c201d10c9a.jpg" alt="All American Stack" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">My main course was the All-American Stack: grilled veggie steak, thousand island dressing, pickles, lettuce, tomato &#8211; topped with onion rings on a wheat bun. The sandwiches &amp; burgers at VeggieGrill come with cabbage slaw or chili as a side, but I opted to upgrade to the Steamin&#8217; Kale.  This sandwich was mighty tasty &#8211; a combination of things I would have never thought to compile on one bun, but it worked well. I wasn&#8217;t a huge fan of the kale, but that&#8217;s mostly my fault &#8211; it comes topped with a ginger-miso dressing, and I kind of sort of hate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger_Kids">ginger</a>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;">Day 1: Sightseeing</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">On Friday, after an early morning 6 mile run through Beverly Hills (which was a few blocks east of where I was staying),  I decided to haphazardly hop in my rental car and see some sights. Most people would, say, go to a museum, or some park or monument. Me? I wanted to geek out on some TV-land stuff. First up: the city of Torrance.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Torrance High School by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5166941581/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4016/5166941581_9ca60cca0f.jpg" alt="Torrance High School" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This is Torrance High School. Why is <em>this</em> a worthy sight you ask? Well, the exteriors for lots of high school tv shows &amp; movies were shot here. Amongst the ones I care about: She&#8217;s All That, Beverly Hills 90210, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  I drove around the back &#8211; which had better, more memory-jogging visuals, but decided not to take any pictures of that, on account of trying to not look like a creepo taking pictures of high school kids.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Buffy's House by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5167557552/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4065/5167557552_3cc1456541.jpg" alt="Buffy's House" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Just a few blocks away from the high school&#8230; Buffy Summers&#8217; house!  Exteriors for Buffy&#8217;s house were shot here. Call me a dork, but I found this to be very.. cool.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;">The Spot</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">Hunger was getting the best of me, so I decided to head towards the coastline and take a little trip to Hermosa Beach. When my wife visited LA a few years back, she raved about the food at <a href="http://www.worldfamousspot.com/">The Spot</a>, especially the Tofu Savory Sauce.  <em>Note: the recipe can be found <a href="http://www.food.com/recipe/creamy-tofu-savory-sauce-277729">here</a>; it is pretty spot-on. Hah!</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Savory Spud by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5153882711/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4007/5153882711_191348481a.jpg" alt="Savory Spud" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I opted for the Savory Spud &#8211; a huge potato, topped with veggies, tempeh, and the savory sauce. This was a beast of a meal &#8211; very filling &#8211; and very tasty. I found the seasoning on the tempeh to be a little oft-putting (perhaps it was too much cumin?) &#8211; but overall, thumbs up.  I paired this dish with an organic <a href="http://bisonbrew.com/product/organic-ipa-pale-ale">Bison IPA</a>, which worked well.  After filling my stomach, I hopped back in the car, turned north and drove to Venice Beach.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="MacGyver's Season 1 House by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5167561880/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4017/5167561880_e22a2b5e84.jpg" alt="MacGyver's Season 1 House" width="374" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Venice Beach is a weird place. <em>Really</em> weird. The house above was MacGyver&#8217;s season 1 residence (it is now a law firm.) I was too early for the Green Flash Happy Hour at the Venice Ale House, so I decided to just walk around. Wow! Venice Beach is a generally pleasant place, but it was filled with hippies, gypsies, people selling all sorts of crappy art, junky rocks, etc. I even saw someone selling twigs labeled as &#8220;magic wands.&#8221; I witnessed the police rolling up onto the boardwalk (well, really a paved path along the beachfront) to stop some sort of food fight. I also passed one of those &#8220;come in, let&#8217;s diagnose your achy knee and get you some weed!&#8221; cannibus clubs &#8211; which just seemed and felt weird.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Whole Foods Vegan Taqueria by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5167566142/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4089/5167566142_a2e04eb6e4.jpg" alt="Whole Foods Vegan Taqueria" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">On my way back to LA from Venice, I stopped in at the Venice Whole Foods. I always like visiting Whole Foods in other cities &#8211; always hopeful that I&#8217;m going to come across some crazy local or regional vegan product or food that I can&#8217;t get back home.  Brett and I once spent close to two hours combing every aisle of a Whole Foods in Boston! I bought no food, but I got a picture of their Vegan Taqueria sign, which seemed pretty cool. I also picked up a bottle of <a href="http://www.lostabbey.com/beer-release-older-viscosity-2010/">Lost Abbey Older Viscosity</a> for sampling later that night. It is liberating to purchase craft beer in your supermarkets; I look forward to the day when this is the norm in Pennsylvania. Older Viscosity is one of my favorite barrel-aged beers; a blend of a hybrid stout/barleywine aged in Bourbon barrels for 1 year. It was the perfect beer to gently coax me into sleep that night.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;">Day 2: Vegan Beer Fest</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">I purposefully skipped dinner Friday night, knowing that I needed to prepare space for the food and beer I was going to consume on Saturday. Saturday started with a very hilly 10 mile run through Beverly Hills, Brentwood, Westwood and other surrounding areas, then a walk up to Sunset Boulevard for the Fest.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="The Roxy by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5153619732/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm2.static.flickr.com/1354/5153619732_feda41b3f3.jpg" alt="The Roxy" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I was excited, but also nervous at the same time, on account of never having actually met any of the LA vegans I follow &amp; interact with on Twitter. I&#8217;ve been to at least a half-dozen beer fests in the past few years and this ended up being <strong>my favorite</strong> out of all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Vegan Beer Fest Glass by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5167766166/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4002/5167766166_8da25375d9.jpg" alt="Vegan Beer Fest Glass" width="374" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The fest was at the Roxy Theatre on Sunset in West Hollywood. It is apparently a somewhat famous club and has hosted a ridiculous amount of famous bands &amp; comedians over the years. VIP ticket holders were treated to an hour pre-fest of beer in the upstairs bar, called <em>On the Rox</em>. This is the very bar where John Belushi apparently partied the night he fatally od&#8217;ed. At the bar they were pouring a few beers from Maui Brewing, and a triple IPA from SpeakEasy called The Don. Potent at 11%, but deliciously incorporating several of my favorite hops (Summit, Centennial, Amarillo) &#8211; this was a winner.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">There were several LA-area food trucks serving food at the fest: <a href="http://thefrankenstand.blogspot.com/">The Frankenstand</a> (vegan sausage cart), <a href="http://twitter.com/yallatruck">Yalla Truck</a> (falafel), <a href="http://www.freshfries.biz">Fresh Fries</a>, <a href="www.mandolinegrill.com/">Mandoline Grill</a> (Vietnamese), <a href="http://seabirdstruck.com/">SeaBirds</a> (vegan burgers/tacos/burritos), and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/doomieshomecookin">Doomie&#8217;s Home Cookin</a>. I sampled from 4 of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Beer Battered Avocado Taco by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5153017709/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/5153017709_d6f21deb6c.jpg" alt="Beer Battered Avocado Taco" width="374" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The first dish I helped myself to was the Beer-battered avocado tacos from Seabirds.  I&#8217;m not sure if words can properly describe how awesome these were. The avocado pieces melted in your mouth as you bit in. Simply put: these were amazing. In fact, I showed this picture to one of my Philly friends when I got back, who happens to be a huge foodie &amp; server at some of the top notch eateries in town. He was so impressed that he turned around and showed it to one of his chefs, who has interest in trying to do something similar. I know <em>I</em> certainly will be trying to make something similar soon!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Jerk Jackfruit Taco by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5153632500/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm2.static.flickr.com/1327/5153632500_fb75e4576d.jpg" alt="Jerk Jackfruit Taco" width="374" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Seabirds also had a Jerk Jackfruit taco which was pretty high on the awesome scale. If you aren&#8217;t familiar, Jackfruit is a very &#8220;fleshy&#8221; fruit. The Memphis Taproom, in Philly (my favorite vegan friendly bar in the world) &#8211; has jackfruit &#8220;crab&#8221; cakes which are great too. If you see vegan jackfruit based dishes, don&#8217;t hesitate to give it a try!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Jalapeno Poppers &amp; Buffalo Legs by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5153022061/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm2.static.flickr.com/1351/5153022061_61aa152947.jpg" alt="Jalapeno Poppers &amp; Buffalo Legs" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Doomie&#8217;s stepped up with jalapeno poppers and hot &#8220;chicken legs.&#8221;  I&#8217;ve actually never had jalapeno poppers before in my life, so my comparison baseline is nonexistent, but these were great &#8211; hot, crispy, and oozing with saucy cheezy goodness inside.  The legs were solid &#8211; I certainly wouldn&#8217;t refuse them, but I suspect they were <a href="http://www.vegieworld.com/cart/product_pages.asp?id=540">May Wah based</a>, so they&#8217;re pretty standard to the wing-type offerings that most cities have.  Doomie&#8217;s also had cupcakes topped with icing that utilized Maui Brewing Coconut Porter.  I did not get a chance to try them, but I wish I had.  I saw many people chomping down on the chocolate covered &#8220;bacon&#8221; they had &#8211; I skipped it because the combination didn&#8217;t really appeal to me.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Vampire Repellent (Garlic Fries) by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5153641078/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4024/5153641078_98a09dfc1d.jpg" alt="Vampire Repellent (Garlic Fries)" width="374" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The only other food I sampled were the &#8220;Vampire Repellant&#8221; fries from Fresh Fries. They were topped with minced garlic.  This combination was very tasty, but i was pretty full at this point.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I had hoped to chronicle each and every beer I tried, but that gets tedious after approximately 1 beer.  I mostly sought out stuff I couldn&#8217;t get back home.  Without question, the beer I was most blown away by was <a href="http://eaglerockbrewery.com/group/solidarityblackmild">Eagle Rock Solidarity Black Mild</a>.  I&#8217;m always intrigued by full-flavored session beers, and this was no exception. Malty, roasty, and under 4% ABV; I wish more breweries did styles like this.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I departed the fest very full, buzzed but not drunk, and overall very happy. It was a very well-behaved fest, full of friendly people chilling out.  Having such an array of awesome food was such a welcome change for those of us who resort to eating like birds at most beer festivals. I slept like a baby Saturday night.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;">Day 3: Madeleine Bistro</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">I woke up Sunday well-rested and looking for more epic food adventures.  After a quick 4 mile run to get my juices flowing, it was off to <a href="http://www.madeleinebistro.com/">Madeleine Bistro</a> &#8211; the area&#8217;s premier upscale vegan eatery. The one negative off the bat: the restaurant is in San Fernando Valley (is this the geographical container for the females that Frank Zappa spoke of in &#8220;Valley Girl&#8221;?) which is a bit of a haul. Luckily the freeway was pretty clear on this Sunday morning.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Caeser Salad by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5167571260/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4038/5167571260_2e7f998955.jpg" alt="Caeser Salad" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I started with the caesar salad.  I&#8217;m a firm believer that this dish is a good indicator of how good a vegan establishment is. This salad was simple, but good (no complaints.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Fried Seitan, Waffles &amp; Mashed Potatoes by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5167578408/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm2.static.flickr.com/1206/5167578408_a875c14e7c.jpg" alt="Fried Seitan, Waffles &amp; Mashed Potatoes" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Next up: Chicken-fried seitan over mashed potatoes with waffles. This was a home run, folks. I was a fan of the beer battered seitan and waffles that are available in Philly at <a href="http://www.milahvegetarian.com/">Mi Lah</a>&#8216;s weekend brunch, but this particular dish blows that away. The seitan itself reminded me of of the cutlets that came in the &#8220;Singing Cowboy&#8221; at the no-longer-existing Veggie Works &#8211; certainly doable at home with some practice &#8211; but hard to make consistently good. The seasoning &amp; spices in the coating were superb.  I do, however have two complaints with regards to this dish: the waffles crumbled too easily (literally fell apart when I cut off a piece to eat) and there should have been 2 pieces of seitan.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Cheesecake by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5166983151/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4087/5166983151_8244903145.jpg" alt="Cheesecake" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">At this point I was fairly full, but still wanted to try more food.  I decided to order a slice of the cheesecake, and a donut. I cannot possibly describe the look of disgust that my waitress gave me as I ordered these additional items to stuff into myself.  The cheesecake was solid but not spectacular.  I&#8217;m a huge fan of <a href="http://www.vegantreats.com/">Vegan Treats</a>, which can be found all over the place locally, and I think they do a better cheesecake (not to mention, they make literally dozens of different flavors/types.)  The $12 price point for a slice is mildly absurd too.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I took the donut to go and ended up eating it later that night.  Though it was not a traditionally-shaped hole-in-middle type, I still devoured it and enjoyed it enough to declare it the best vegan donut I&#8217;ve ever consumed.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">After waddling back to the car and heading back to LA, I met up with the <a href="http://quarrygirl.com">quarrygirl</a> gang to check out <a href="http://www.tonysda.com/">Tony&#8217;s Darts Away</a>, a draft-only beer bar in Burbank. Still full from the brunch, I didn&#8217;t get to try some of their vegan specialties (like their sausages.)  I did, however, enjoy a few tasty adult beverages (2008 Stone IRS, Port Brewing Mongo IPA, and Stone Belgo Stout) which were all served well &amp; proper.  The Belgo Stout actually reminded me a lot of the oak-aged Belgian Imperial Wheat Stout that I brewed this year (which means I should probably post that recipe in the near future.)</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;">VeggieGrill</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">Eventually I got hungry again (this happens every 2 hours or so for me.)  While waiting for The Surly Goat to open, I walked up to VeggieGrill&#8217;s location on Sunset for some grub.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Blackened Chicken Caeser Wrap w/ Mac &amp; Cheese by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5167597390/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm2.static.flickr.com/1438/5167597390_c01cbbafc2.jpg" alt="Blackened Chicken Caeser Wrap w/ Mac &amp; Cheese" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I went with the chick&#8217;n caesar wrap with a side of mac-and-cheese. Undoubtedly, this was the best wrap I&#8217;ve had in my life. The mac-and-cheese was very good, though a tad bit on the sweet side.  Bonus: VeggieGrill CEO Kevin Boylan was walking around handing out free cookies to all patrons as a thank you for visiting. <strong>Awesome!</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;">The Surly Goat</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">After my meal I walked back to The Surly Goat, a West Hollywood beer bar.  Besides having the most awesome bar name ever, I was blown away by the beer offerings.  Immediately I knew I was in trouble: there was just too much to sample and I just <em>had</em> to try as much as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Lost Abbey Red Poppy by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5167529326/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4027/5167529326_971655f9aa.jpg" alt="Lost Abbey Red Poppy" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Red Poppy, from Lost Abbey, is one of my favorite sour beers.  It is a Flanders Brown (oud bruin) aged on sour cherries &amp; an extreme rarity in Philly.  If you like sour, funky beers, this is a must try.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Lost Abbey Cuvee de Tomme by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5167533504/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm2.static.flickr.com/1390/5167533504_8ef9505628.jpg" alt="Lost Abbey Cuvee de Tomme" width="374" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I also saw Lost Abbey&#8217;s Cuvee de Tomme on the bottle list.  This beer is an 11% Belgian Brown Ale aged on sour cherries in a Brett-innoculated bourbon barrels. It is truly a one of a kind beer (it is usually very tough for beers that high in alcohol to sour this dramatically.)  I had it once before: Brett &amp; I split a 375mL bottle last year.  Unfortunately this was a 750mL bottle.  Though I shared some with the bartenders, this proved to be the last beer I could handle for the evening.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;">Day 4: M Cafe</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">Before heading back to the airport for my return voyage, I hit up M Cafe in Beverly Hills for some brunch.  M Cafe is an interesting place. Given the emphasis on macrobiotic offerings, I originally mistook it for being all-vegan, until I realized half the menu contain fish, which is somewhat of a bummer. Nonetheless, it is worth visting &#8211; it is clean, fresh &amp; good &#8211; reminding me somewhat of the now-defunct NYC eatery, Bachue (a former favorite of mine.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Breakfast Burrito by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5167607390/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4064/5167607390_17494e050a.jpg" alt="Breakfast Burrito" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I ordered the breakfast burrito with an avocado addition.  The brown rice wrap bundled up an inviting mixture of tofu, black beans, brown rice, kale, &amp; vegan cheddar cheese.  It came with a side of a spicy chipotle sauce, which had a very citrusy element to it and really helped the flavors of the burrito to pop.  For my final meal in Los Angeles, this really hit the spot.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Los Angeles was a blast. The weather was pleasant, the palm trees were plentiful, I made some new friends and got to sample &amp; savour a ton of awesome food and beer.  I look forward to returning some day!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: I originally meant to post this many, many months ago.</em></p>
<p>One of the opening events to start <a href="http://www.phillybeerweek.org/">Philly Beer Week</a> was a New Glarus Wisconsin Belgian Red kickoff toast at The South Philadelphia Taproom.  SPTR has been a favorite beer bar of mine for several years now &#8211; I consider it the spot that truly introduced me to local craft beer in a relaxed, comfy atmosphere.  When my brother still lived in South Philly too, I&#8217;d find myself there <em>all</em> the time.  I always feel welcome, and these days, I always enjoy their vegan hoagie &#8211; a delicious mound of tempeh, marinated mushrooms, and slightly spicy homemade veganaise atop a lightly toasted hoagie roll, accompanied by fries and homemade ketchup.  How good is this stuff?  I usually like neither veganaise nor ketchup, but I love the versions served here.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="http://www.newglarusbrewing.com/">New Glaru</a>s is a [<a href="http://www.barnivore.com/beer/New Glarus Brewing Company">vegan</a>] brewery in Wisconsin, who only distribute in Wisconsin.  Therefore &#8211; it is very very rare to find them on the east coast.  Since they legally could not be sold here &#8211; SPTR was giving away free tastings!</p>
<p>The Wisconsin Belgian Red is the <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/top_beers?this_cId=&amp;this_style=&amp;cId=&amp;style=9">#1 rated fruit beer on beeradvocate.com</a>.  It is delicious.  Very tart, slightly sour (but not lambic or belgian sour territory sourness), midly cidery acetic, noticeably syrupy.  I liked it a lot, as did Beth.  When I suggested I could attempt to brew something similar, she was pretty excited.</p>
<p>After some research I found out that New Glarus uses roughly 2 whole pounds of fresh cherries per 750mL bottle.  Whoah.  For me to pull that off would be nearly impossible.  Not to mention &#8211; incredibly messy.  I stumbled upon an old issue of Zymurgy that suggested a cheaper, easier way to clone it would involve using a lot of high quality cherry juice &#8211; roughly 20% of the volume.  Here&#8217;s my attempt.</p>
<h1>Belgian Tart Cherry</h1>
<ul>
<li>5 lb US 2-Row</li>
<li>2 lb US Red Wheat Malt</li>
<li>6 oz Crystal 40 Malt</li>
<li>.5 oz Belgian Special B Malt</li>
<li>.3 oz Organic New Zealand Hallertau Whole Leaf Hops [8.5% AA] (40)</li>
<li>White Labs <a href="http://www.whitelabs.com/beer/strains_wlp530.html">WLP530 Abbey Ale</a> yeast</li>
<li>1 gallon <a href="http://www.knudsenjuice.com/products/pure_juice/organic_just_tart_cherry">Knudsen Organic Just Tart Cherry Juice</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Single Infusion mash at 154.  Target 4 gallons of wort for primary fermentation.  When primary has slowed, rack on to the cherry juice (giving you 5 gallons total) and let condition for a few weeks.  The cherry juice is going to almost fully ferment in 2 weeks or so.  I did this in the keg and just force carbonated when it was done.</p>
<p>This beer turned out okay.  I don&#8217;t think juice is a suitable replacement for all of the fresh cherries that the Wisconsin Belgian Red uses.  The beer finished very very dry and the aroma was very one-dimensional.  Using fruit puree &#8211; like the sterilized cans of puree that <a href="http://www.oregonfruit.com">Oregon Fruits</a> produces, I think, would be a step in the right direction.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[that is such a great idea, and sounds really good.  i love abbey dubbels but as you mention, they are often too brutally high in alcohol to drink more than a few.

are you in philly?  i live in the city and would &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; to try some of this!

by the way i just discovered your blog today.  as a vegan beer and food lover, i just wanna say great job!]]></description>

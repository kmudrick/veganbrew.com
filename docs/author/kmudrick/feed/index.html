					<description><![CDATA[Philadelphia prides itself on being "America's Best Beer-Drinking City," which may be a debateable topic (look how many other cities have attempted to copy our "beer week.")  I'd argue, without question, that Philly is also America's most vegan-friendly-beer-drinking city.  In other words, when I'm out drinking, I want good vegan pub food.  And without a doubt, I get that at many, if not all, of the establishments I normally frequent.

Here's my attempt at introducing &#38; summarizing what you can get while visiting the many bars &#38; pubs around town.  My criteria was simple:

    Must have multiple vegan options on the menu, clearly marked as such.  Lame attempts like hummus &#38; portabello sandwiches don't count.
    Must have craft beer.  No crap on tap!

I'll start from deep South Philly (where I live), working my way north through the city, as far as Fishtown, before swinging out west to University City.  I don't think I've missed anything, but please let me know if I have!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Philadelphia prides itself on being &#8220;America&#8217;s Best Beer-Drinking City,&#8221; which may be a debateable topic (look how many other cities have attempted to copy our &#8220;<a href="http://www.phillybeerweek.org/about_beer_week.cfm">beer week</a>.&#8221;)  I&#8217;d argue, without question, that Philly is also America&#8217;s most vegan-friendly-beer-drinking city.  In other words, when I&#8217;m out drinking, I want good vegan pub food.  And without a doubt, I get that at many, if not all, of the establishments I normally frequent.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my attempt at introducing &amp; summarizing what you can get while visiting the many bars &amp; pubs around town.  My criteria was simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must have multiple vegan options on the menu, <em>clearly marked</em> as such.  Lame attempts like hummus &amp; portabello sandwiches don&#8217;t count.</li>
<li>Must have craft beer.  No crap on tap!</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ll start from deep South Philly (where I live), working my way north through the city, as far as Fishtown, before swinging out west to University City.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve missed anything, but please let me know if I have!</p>
<h2>South Philadelphia Tap Room</h2>
<p>SPTR has a special place in my heart &#8211; for the longest time it was the only craft beer bar in my area of town &#8211; and it is the place where I learned to love craft beer.  In fact, I still remember the 3 beers I had my first visit over 7 years ago: Victory Throwback Lager (a pre-prohibition style lager), Hoegaarden, and Troegs Dreamweaver Wheat.</p>
<p>The tap room has 13 taps and one cask-ale hand pump &#8211; always filled with a variety of awesome stuff.  Their main vegan option on the menu is the <strong>vegan hoagie</strong> &#8211; grilled tempeh, marinated mushrooms and tofu mayo on a long roll.  I&#8217;ve traditionally not been a fan of any mayo-type foods, vegan or not, but this stuff is to die for.  For the longest time I felt this was the best vegan sandwich in the city, though it has some serious competition now (see Khyber Pass Pub below.)  Pair it with the steak fries &#8211; which come with the best homemade ketchup in the world (I normally <em>don&#8217;t</em> like ketchup, but I love this!)  During weekend brunch, you can get a nice tofu scramble dish as well.  Sometimes the soup specials are vegan; check the menu &#8211; they normally label everything appropriately.  They also recently introduced a <strong>vegan pizza</strong> as a starter &#8211; roasted eggplant, spicy marinated cherry tomatoes, baby arugula, black olive olive oil, which is fantastic provided you like the flavor of black olives.</p>
<p>They also own &amp; operate BREW across the street, which is a coffee bar &amp; takeout beer shop all in one.  They probably have the best selection of takeout beer in South Philly.</p>
<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=south+philadelphia+tap+room&amp;aq=&amp;sll=39.979619,-75.123718&amp;sspn=0.009356,0.022724&amp;gl=us&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=south+philadelphia+tap+room&amp;hnear=&amp;z=13&amp;iwloc=A&amp;cid=12792982392777884147">1509 Mifflin Street, South Philly (Newbold)</a><br />
From the subway (orange line) get off at Tasker/Morris, walk south on Broad 2 blocks to Mifflin, and head west on Mifflin for a block &amp; a half<br />
<a href="http://southphiladelphiataproom.com/">http://southphiladelphiataproom.com</a></p>
<h2>Cantina Los Caballitos</h2>
<p>The Cantina is probably my go-to spot for food, year round.  On the vibrant and now-hip East Passyunk Ave, this Mexican restaurant/bar has a handful of craft beer taps, but more importantly, <strong>vegan fajitas</strong>.  These fajitas are no joke: smoked tofu, perfect seitan, wild mushrooms, onions &amp; peppers, black beans, rice, guacamole&#8230; It is suitable for splitting between two people (but I rarely do, instead opting to roll myself home afterwards.)  Dining in at Cantina also means a bottomless bowl of freshly made chips and two salsas for dipping (red &amp; verde.)  Like the other bars from this owner (Royal Tavern, Khyber Pass Pub) &#8211; everything vegan is marked as such on the specials board &amp; in the menu.</p>
<p>If the vegan fajitas are too much food for you &#8211; try the <strong>vegan beef burritos</strong>, or go light and refreshing with a <strong>mixta salad</strong> (avocado, romaine lettuce, jicama, orange sections, radishes, almonds, piquin chile vinaigrette.) If you have room after your meal, they always have <a href="http://www.vegantreats.com">Vegan Treats</a> cake available for dessert.  Prime eating hours are usually pretty cramped here, with a decently hipster&#8217;ish crowd, so be warned.</p>
<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=7821933525133715324&amp;q=Cantina+Los+Caballitos,+Philadelphia,+PA&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ved=0CBMQ-gswAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ynAaTsTADYf2zASf-LSOAw&amp;sig2=KrZs-oQAjTBgXuvPFYbTXA">1651 East Passyunk Ave (at Morris St), South Philly (East Passyunk Crossing)</a><br />
Via subway (the orange line) &#8211; get off at the Tasker/Morris stop and walk east on Morris.<br />
<a href="http://www.cantinaloscaballitos.com">http://www.cantinaloscaballitos.com</a></p>
<h2>POPE</h2>
<p>Just a few blocks north of the Cantina on Passyunk lies the Pub on Passyunk East, or as most people call it, The POPE.  This dark bar (with a dungeon-y feel to it) has 14 craft beer taps &amp; several vegan food items on the menu (clearly marked as well &#8211; notice a trend?)  Beer-wise, they almost always have Sly Fox O&#8217;Reilly Stout on a nitro tap, for those seeking a Guinness-esque (but fishgut-free) dry irish stout.  Their happy hour (4-6pm during the week) offers you half-priced draughts.  They regularly get all of the &#8220;good&#8221; stuff that gets distributed to Philly &#8211; think Russian River Supplication &amp; Lost Abbey Angel&#8217;s Share.  On the food side of things, you can find fried <strong>seitan fingers</strong>, &amp; a <strong>seitan cheesesteak</strong> (with a cheeze-wiz&#8217;esque nutritional yeast-y type of vegan cheese)<del>, and a mushroom &amp; nut <strong>meatloaf</strong></del>.  (Edit 11/9/11: Menu was recently downsized, and the vegan meatloaf is now gone.) Sometimes their daily specials include vegan options, so check the board outside of the bathroom.  And on the weekends you can stop by for brunch, which always has at least 2 vegan options.</p>

<a href="http://pubonpassyunkeast.com">http://pubonpassyunkeast.com</a></p>
<h2>Royal Tavern</h2>
<p>If you continue heading north/east on Passyunk for another half-mile, you&#8217;ll reach the Royal Tavern.  Owned by the same people as the Cantina, this really cozy establishment (complete with original tin ceiling &amp; a gorgeous bar) has been cranking out vegan pub food for what seems like forever.  They have 8 craft taps (usually featuring a lot of east coast favorites) and a decent-sized bottle list.  Their menu tends to rotate every few months, but they always have several vegan salads, entrees, and sandwiches (clearly marked) along with daily specials.  Some of the more awesome&#8217;r things I have had at Royal: <strong>tempeh club </strong>(grilled tempeh, vegan bacon, lettuce, tomato, basil aioli) and the <strong>sloppy joe</strong> (vegan beef, spicy tomato sauce, smoked coleslaw, sliced jalapenos.)  Like their sister establishments, you can find Vegan Treats cakes offered for dessert.  On the weekends, check them out for brunch and try the <strong>tofu &amp; tempeh hash </strong>(roasted tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach, breakfast potatoes, toast.)  Bonus points for having Xlerator hand dryers in the bathroom here as well!</p>

<h2>Monk&#8217;s Cafe</h2>
<p>Monk&#8217;s Cafe is one of the premier Belgian bars in America.  Tom Peters, Monk&#8217;s owner, is directly responsible for first introducing Chimay to Americans, back in the 80s.  Monk&#8217;s is also directly responsible for getting some of the west coast&#8217;s best breweries to distribute to the Philadelphia area (Russian River, Lost Abbey / Port Brewing.)  You&#8217;ll regularly find 13 craft &amp; Belgian beers at the back bar and 6 at the front, along with arguably (actually &#8211; this is not remotely debateable) the best bottle list in the city &#8211; chock full of all the vintage and hard-to-get beers that people regularly drool over on beeradvocate.com</p>
<p>If you grow hungry while getting your drink on at Monk&#8217;s, well then you are in luck!  They always have several vegan options on their seasonally-rotating menu; currently you can find <strong>summer wraps</strong> (seitan, papaya, peaches, sweet peppers, fresh corn &amp; jicama wrapped in romaine leaf with mint &amp; sesame lime dressing), a <del><strong>vegan burger </strong></del>(2012 Note: the bun is disappointingly no longer vegan) , <strong>grilled moroccan seitan pita</strong>, a <strong>seitan cheesesteak</strong> (omit the cheese to make it vegan), and <strong>vegan meatballs </strong>(seitan &amp; mushroom meatballs over udon noodles tossed with a nut-based romesco sauce.)</p>
<p>Monk&#8217;s also has many special beer dinners throughout the year.  If you give them advance notice, they will make sure all of your food pairings for the dinner are vegan (and excellent.)  I&#8217;ve attended two of these thus far and they were unbelievable.  A word of warning: this place can get very crowded during peak dining hours &amp; during any special events &#8211; and the space is pretty cramped as-is.  But it is a must stop for anyone seeking great beer in Philadelphia.</p>
<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=13564498605459172556&amp;q=Monk%27s+Cafe,+South+16th+Street,+Philadelphia,+PA&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ved=0CBQQ-gswAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BHEaTonaKYSizQSDws3cCA&amp;sig2=uFLlDnbWru8BmaelCdygLw">264 South 16th Street (at Spruce), Center City (Rittenhouse Square)</a><br />
Via the subway (orange line) get off at Walnut/Locust, walk west on Locust 2 blocks to 16th, then 1 block south<br />
<a href="http://www.monkscafe.com">http://www.monkscafe.com</a></p>
<h2>Nodding Head</h2>
<p>Walking a few blocks north of Monk&#8217;s will lead you to Nodding Head brewpub &amp; restaurant.  A quick warning: Nodding Head fines a bunch of their beers with isinglass, so you&#8217;ll need to ask a waiter or bartender which beers on tap at the time are vegan.  Usually, they only fine their hoppy beers (their pales &amp; IPAs) so mainstays like the Grog (a nice sessionable english brown ale), 60 Shilling (scottish ale) and Monkey Knife Fight (lemongrass &amp; ginger lager) are safe.  They also have one of the best American examples of berliner weisse &#8211; the Ich Bin Ein Berliner Weisse, which is never fined.</p>
<p><del>On the food front, you can find several tasty vegan items: <strong>white beans and sage</strong> (a tasty stew served with warm pita bread), <strong>vegan burger</strong>, and <strong>polenta puttanesca </strong>(polenta, mushrooms, basil tofu in a puttanesca sauce.)  Nodding Head is a very fun place to hang out at with friends (they have dart boards and the 2nd level view of Sansom Street is nice) and the crowd is usually pretty manageable.  If I worked in Center City, I&#8217;d probably find myself stopping here for lunch quite often.</del></p>
<p>2/19/2012 Note: as of recently, the &#8220;vegan burger&#8221; is served on an egg-washed roll &amp; the polenta puttanesca is no longer vegan (it has actual dairy cream in it, as per the last waiter I had.)  With the diminishing vegan options here, I can no longer recommend a visit.</p>
<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=1300189742141597580&amp;q=nodding+head&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ved=0CBIQ-gswAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=C00aTqbBN4K0yQW4q-GMDw&amp;sig2=Xv9itKBcnfpaLZUbcpFBSg">1516 Sansom St (between 15th and 16th), Center City</a><br />
From the subway (orange line) get off at Walnut-Locust, walk a block north to Sansom, then head west for a block &amp; a half<br />
From the subway (blue line) get off at City Hall, walk a block and a half south on 16th, then head west a half block<br />

<h2>Belgian Cafe</h2>
<p>Heading north-west of Center City towards the Art Museum / Fairmount area, you&#8217;ll find a plethora of nice bars.  My favorite to go to is the Belgian Cafe, from the same owners of Monks Cafe.  When the weather is pleasant, it is a nice 1.3 mile walk from City Hall up the parkway, past the Art Museum (run up the steps like Rocky if you must!) to the Belgian Cafe, where you will be greeted with 12 taps featuring great belgian imports and craft beer.  The beer list tends to include more accessible beers than the often-rare offerings that their sister bar features, but it is stellar nonetheless.</p>
<p>Foodwise.. the Belgian Cafe never disappoints my friends and I &#8211; the menu is borderline epic.  For starters, you can get the <strong>stuffed tofu</strong> (tofu marinated in Spaten Optimator, stuffed with dried cherries, cashews, cilantro, &amp; garlic), the <strong>vegan bbq wings</strong> (corn meal crusted seitan &#8220;wings&#8221; with spicy bbq sauce &#8211; be sure to ask for the vegan basil aoli to dip in!), or the <strong>vegan spring rolls</strong>.  If you want a sandwich or entree, you can go with the<strong> vegan burger </strong>or <strong>vegan tempeh cakes</strong> (tempeh with dill-lemon vegan aioli, grilled corn &amp; grilled asparagus.)  If you happen to find yourself at the Belgian Cafe on the weekend during brunch, you can get the <strong>vegan cream chipped beef</strong> (sliced seitan with well seasoned tofu &#8220;cream&#8221; served over multigrain toast.)  Bonus points: Xlerators in the bathroom!</p>
<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Belgian+Cafe,+Philadelphia,+PA&amp;aq=0&amp;sll=39.937432,-75.154467&amp;sspn=0.009362,0.022724&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=Belgian+Cafe,&amp;hnear=Philadelphia,+Pennsylvania&amp;ll=39.967648,-75.168114&amp;spn=0.03743,0.090895&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=A&amp;cid=2194224345390391110">601 North 21st St (at Green), North Philly (Fairmount)</a><br />
From the subway (orange line) get off at Spring Garden, walk west 7 blocks, then head north on 21st for 2 blocks until you hit Green<br />
<a href="http://www.thebelgiancafe.com">http://www.thebelgiancafe.com</a></p>
<h2>Khyber Pass Pub</h2>
<p>Since the Khyber revamped itself in the last year (new ownership &#8211; same owners as the Royal &amp; the Cantina &#8211; and new focus on dining &amp; beer) there is no better place to go for pub &amp; grub in Old City. Or possibly anywhere in the city, period. 20 taps (including 1 nitro) &amp; 2 cask hand pumps &#8211; few places have such a great selection.  You&#8217;re almost always guaranteed to find a fresh cask of Yards ESA on one the hand pumps &#8211; few beers pair so well with that style of serving &#8211; and they often have beers you just don&#8217;t see around town.  I can&#8217;t gush enough about the beer here &#8211; but what really rules is the food!</p>
<p>The Khyber prides itself on Cajun/Southern BBQ comfort food, and doesn&#8217;t leave us vegans out in the wind.  Everything on the menu and the specials board is clearly marked.  For starters, you can have the <strong>vegan buttered popcorn</strong> (sometimes they have a vegan bacon salt varient as well!), the <strong>nachos</strong> with <strong>vegan bbq pork</strong> (sans cheese &amp; sour cream) or one of the daily soup specials (like <strong>gazpacho</strong> or <strong>gumbo z&#8217;herbes</strong>, which is currently my favorite soup in the entire world.)  If you have room for something bigger, you can get the <strong>vegan bbq pulled pork sandwich</strong>, the <strong>grilled vegan sausage sandwich</strong>, or the <strong>vegan fried chicken po-boys</strong> (complete with an awesome homemade vegan mayo that even <em>I</em> like.)  All sandwiches come with one side; the vegan sides include <strong>fries</strong>, <strong>sweet potato fries</strong>, <strong>mashed potatoes</strong> (my recommendation), <strong>collard greens</strong>, and <strong>vegan coleslaw</strong>.  Like their sister restaurants, you can get Vegan Treats cakes for dessert (I&#8217;ve sometimes stopped here just for cake after catching a movie at one of the nearby Ritz theatres.)  Bonus points: Xlerators in the bathroom!  Extra Bonus Points: they host many of the Vegan Cocktails Philly events &amp; pull out even more vegan offerings (like vegan &#8220;meat&#8221; pies) on those nights.</p>
<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=13108865246812916942&amp;q=khyber+pass+pub,+Philadelphia,+PA&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ved=0CBMQ-gswAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HnEaTv_2NISizQS9q83UCA&amp;sig2=hM9iMSEj0yGhRTPKosMF3g">56 South 2nd St (at Chestnut), Center City (Old City)</a><br />
From the subway (blue line), get off at 2nd st and walk south one block<br />
<a href="http://www.khyberpasspub.com">http://www.khyberpasspub.com</a></p>
<h2>Cantina Dos Segundas</h2>
<p>For completeness sake, I&#8217;m including Dos Segundas here, even though the menu is very similar to Cantina Los Caballitos (same chef, same owners, same vegan fajitas!)  Last week I heard they had <strong>jackfruit tacos</strong> as a special.  Yum.  Dos Segunas has a very convenient location in Northern Liberties, a few doors down from the Foodery, who offers the best selection of takeout beer in the city (albeit at <em>very</em> premium prices.)  On Thursday nights, around 7:30, you can usually see me and a pack of 30-50 other crazies running south on 2nd, past Dos Segundas, as we (the <a href="http://fishtownbeerrunners.blogspot.com">Fishtown Beer Runners</a>) often run down 2nd as our route towards Center City bar destinations.</p>
<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=14805102122921708169&amp;q=Cantina+Dos+Segundos,+North+2nd+Street,+Philadelphia,+PA&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ved=0CBMQ-gswAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MHEaTonNLJCIyQTW6YjRCQ&amp;sig2=aN3DfmqIDyoO-sPb1WT0ow">931 North 2nd St, North Philly (Northern Liberties)</a><br />
From the subway (blue line), get off at Spring Garden, walk west to 2nd St, then up 2nd St for 3 blocks.<br />

<h2>Memphis Taproom</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve already detailed the recent <a title="Vegan Beer Dinner at Memphis Taproom" href="https://veganbrew.com/2011/06/11/vegan-beer-dinner-at-memphis-taproom/">Vegan Beer Dinner at Memphis</a>, so it should be no surprise that this place is one of the best pubs in town due to its stellar beer selection (10 taps, 2 hand pumps) and killer vegan food.  The well-marked menu rotates seasonally, so some dishes may come and go (like some of my favorites: the <strong>jackfruit &#8220;crab&#8221; cakes</strong>, the <strong>beer-battered miso tofu </strong>(fish &amp; chips style), and the <strong>smoked avocado lettuce &amp; tomato sandwich</strong>.)  Currently they have <strong>grilled peach</strong> (with buckwheat noodles, sesame, cucumber, cilantro), <strong>charred string beans</strong>, <strong>chicken-fried portabello sandwich</strong> (not your ordinary portabello &amp; veggie sandwich!  with vegan mayo), a vegan <strong>veggie burger</strong>, the famous <strong>smoked coconut club </strong>(grilled lemon garlic tofu, smoked coconut, tomato herb mayo), and <strong>shitake schnitzel</strong> (smoked potato salad, braised red cabbage, mustard “cream” sauce.)  On occasion, I&#8217;ve gotten some vegan desserts like cookies here. For brunch, you can get the veggie burger or the <strong>vegan rooster</strong> (tofu scramble with vegan blood sausage, smoked coconut, roasted new potatoes and toast.)</p>
<p>Outside, Memphis has a cute beer garden where you can drink cans of craft beer along with gourmet hot dogs (they have vegan dogs there).  Memphis is a little out of the way for anyone that doesn&#8217;t live in North Philly &#8211; but it is totally worth the trip.  Bonus points?  You guessed it, Xlerators in the bathrooms.</p>
<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=8940309585578090934&amp;q=memphis+taproom+philadelphia&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ved=0CBMQ-gswAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=G2UaTr3LFJKqzQTlyrXZCQ&amp;sig2=6ZCuM8wpxF0qK50Kbol7fw">2231 East Cumberland St (at Memphis), North Philly (Fishtown / Port Richmond / Kensington)</a><br />
From the subway (blue line), get off at Berks, walk north a block to Norris, take a right, follow Norris 4 blocks to Memphis, turn left and walk 9 (short) blocks to Cumberland<br />

<h2>Local 44</h2>
<p>Out in University City (near UPenn &amp; Drexel) &#8211; Local 44 is, without a doubt, a must stop.  Owned by the same awesome couple as the Memphis Taproom, with the same genius chef behind the menu, you&#8217;ll find yourself staring down 18 taps and 2 hand pumps, then drooling over the extensive vegan food offerings (all clearly marked on the menu.)  Like the menu at Memphis, some of the food changes from time to time, but the vegan options are <em>always</em> plentiful.</p>
<p>For starters, you have the <strong>warm spinach dip &amp; pita chips</strong> (roasted garlic, fried onions, mornay sauce), <strong>chips &amp; dip</strong> (sea-salt chips, french onion dip), <strong>grilled peach salad</strong> (avocado, baby arugula, sesame wasabi vinaigrette), <strong>shrooms &amp; chips</strong> (chicken-fried portabella strips, maple mustard, red bbq sauce).  If you want a sandwich, try the <strong>pastrami spiced seitan reuben</strong> or a <strong>black bean burger</strong>.  Even hungrier?  Go for the <strong>mac provencal</strong> (sundried tomatoes, soy mornay, olives, rosemary, orange zest.)</p>
<p>If you are looking for brunch at Local 44 &#8211; they&#8217;ve got you covered there as well!  There is something called <strong>migas</strong> (tortillas, tofu, peppers, onions, ro-tel queso), <strong>tofu scramble</strong>, <strong>shirred tofu</strong> (garlic tofu, sautéed spinach, mornay sauce, roasted potatoes and toast), and <strong>shitake scrapple</strong>.  For anyone not from the area &#8211; scrapple is a &#8220;pennsylvania specialty&#8221; and involves a gross mush of pork scraps (literally), cornmeal, and flour.  This varient uses tasty mushrooms instead.  The best brunch item they have, however, are the <strong>pb&amp;j french toast sticks</strong> (with brown sugar banana cream &amp; dark chocolate).  A few months back, a group of 5 of us (longtime vegans) all split this and pretty much ranked it amongst the best dishes we have ever had. Period. You can also get the seitan reuben or the black bean burger for brunch.</p>

<h2>Mad Mex</h2>
<p>Mad Mex is a Mexican restaurant nestled right in the middle of UPenn&#8217;s campus.  They&#8217;ve been offering tofu sour cream &amp; vegan cheese in their burritos for well over a decade &#8211; dating as far back as the late 90s when vegan-rella was the best you could get.  I don&#8217;t go here as often as I used to, but there&#8217;s plenty to be had: over a dozen different burritos, many of which can be veganized by choosing the grilled portabellos or marinated tofu as the protein source.  If you don&#8217;t want a burrito (or enchiladas, or quesadillas, you can get the <strong>pennsyltucky fried tofu</strong> (tossed in sweet soy sauce, peanuts, sesame seeds &amp; cilantro), the<strong> chickpea chili soup</strong> (you can get the vegan cheese &amp; tofu sour cream on this as well), or the <strong>herb-o-vore&#8217;s tofu tacos</strong>.  Beer-wise, you&#8217;ll find 20 taps of mostly craft beer (with some clunkers like PBR &amp; miller lite thrown in there &#8211; this is a college bar after all.)  Bonus awesomeness: show a student id from 11pm-1am any night of the week and your food is half price.  (The student id is a new requirement.)  This place gets very crowded late night during the school year.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Oaked Belgian Imperial Wheat Stout: say that three times!  Or just shorten it with "Allagash Odyssey Clone".

Odyssey happens to be my favorite non-sour from Allagash.  Essentially, it is a big stout, brewed with a healthy portion of wheat, fermented with belgian yeast, and aged in new American Oak barrels for some amount of time.  I highly recommend trying this beer - my first taste of it precluded the recent belgiany-stout rash that seems to be going around, so it will always be special to me.

A few years back Rob Todd, owner of Allagash, was at a "Meet The Brewer" type event at the South Philadelphia Taproom.  I kept gushing about how much I loved Odyssey, so after encouragement from my wife and prodding via text from Brett, I worked up the nerve to walk up to Mr Todd, tell him how much I loved Odyssey, and ask him how to brew it.

"I can't tell you that, it's secret! ... Just kidding" he began with.  He proceeded to give me an array of pointers which got me on the right track to brewing a similar beer.  It was an awesome experience, and Rob Todd is a straight up awesome dude.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oaked Belgian Imperial Wheat Stout: say that three times!  Or just shorten it with &#8220;Allagash Odyssey Clone&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.allagash.com/beer/specialty/odyssey">Odyssey</a> happens to be my favorite non-sour from Allagash.  Essentially, it is a big stout, brewed with a healthy portion of wheat, fermented with belgian yeast, and aged in new American Oak barrels for some amount of time.  I highly recommend trying this beer &#8211; my first taste of it precluded the recent belgiany-stout rash that seems to be going around, so it will always be special to me.</p>
<p>A few years back Rob Todd, owner of Allagash, was at a &#8220;Meet The Brewer&#8221; type event at the South Philadelphia Taproom.  I kept gushing about how much I loved Odyssey, so after encouragement from my wife and prodding via text from Brett, I worked up the nerve to walk up to Mr Todd, tell him how much I loved Odyssey, and ask him how to brew it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you that, it&#8217;s secret! &#8230; Just kidding&#8221; he began with.  He proceeded to give me an array of pointers which got me on the right track to brewing a similar beer.  It was an awesome experience, and Rob Todd is a straight up awesome dude.</p>
<p>My general notes from my conversation with Rob:</p>
<ul>
<li>A lot of cane sugar; cheap and easily fermentable to ensure dryness</li>
<li>Roughly approaching it like a stout in terms of proportions of roasted grains &#8211; but trying for a pretty even (40/60 or 50/50) ratio of wheat to 2-row/pale</li>
<li>Belgian Wheat (<strong><em>not</em></strong> wit) yeast strain that will give good phenolics &amp; mild spices while playing off the wheat, and being able to ferment a high gravity beer</li>
<li>Age a portion on <strong>New</strong> American Oak (American oak is more vanilla-y &amp; aggressive than French oak) and the rest in stainless (and then blend)</li>
</ul>
<p>Since this was going to be such a big beer (10+% ABV) and I had just used <a href="http://www.wyeastlab.com/hb_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=137">Wyeast 3942 Belgian Wheat</a>, I decided to dump the wort on top of the used yeast cake from my <a title="Belgian Mild" href="https://veganbrew.com/2009/12/30/belgian-mild/">Belgian Mild</a>.  I generally try to target 6 gallons at the end of the boil, getting 5.5 gallons into the fermentor on most of my beers, so this recipe reflects that.</p>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
<li>9lb US 2-Row (42%)</li>
<li>7lb 8oz white wheat malt (35%)</li>
<li>1lb roasted barley (5%)</li>
<li>8 oz Belgian debittered black malt (2%)</li>
<li>3.5 oz flaked barley (1%)</li>
<li>2 lbs sugar (9%)</li>
<li>1 lb light dried malt extract (because I missed gravity)</li>
<li>6 oz wheat malt extract (because I missed gravity)</li>
<li>Wyeast 3942 &#8211; Belgian Wheat</li>
<li>.7 oz Galena (14.1 AA%) at 60 minutes</li>
<li>.4oz Hallertau Hersbrucker (3.8 AA%) at 5 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>I had major efficiency issues with this batch.  I inadvertantly opened up the rollers on my grain mill too much, and ended up with a pre-boil gravity off by nearly 14 points!  To compensate, I added 6oz wheat DME and 1lb light DME and boosted the sugar to 2 pounds (from 1.5.)  The DME &amp; extra sugar helped close the gravity gap a bit &#8211; my OG ended up only being 4 points off (1.085.)  I fermented this batch at 68, using a chest freezer with a temperature regulator.  This strain has a range up to 74, but I really wanted to keep the phenolics to a minimum.</p>
<p>After 12 days fermenting (very vigorously, very quickly &#8211; I had to rely on a blowoff for this batch) I was down to 1.016.  At this point, I transferred into a corny keg and added the oak.  I used 2 oz of American Oak cubes from <a href="http://www.williamsbrewing.com/4_OZ_AMERICAN_OAK_CUBES_P2085.cfm">Williams Brewing</a> (Boiling in water for 15 minutes to sanitize.)  I aged this keg for 8 months at basement temperatures (for me, mid 60s in the winter), the final 2 being at 55 (back into the chest freezer.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/9-aAxRS11YezKOI5XwuN4r54h0U_F9LING2kAQ7nxYE?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh6.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TQGhM571GyI/AAAAAAAAAOI/6LR0W4htC8I/s400/IMG_0504.JPG" alt="" width="299" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/hCtcth6OHODO5KBaTOZaqL54h0U_F9LING2kAQ7nxYE?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh3.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TQGhOfFAOoI/AAAAAAAAAOM/vg-QiF8pzag/s400/IMG_0506.JPG" alt="" width="299" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The final verdict?  I loved this beer.  Rich mouthfeel, pleasant roastyness, excellent head retention.  Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t think it tasted very much like Odyssey &#8211; the phenolics in this beer were much more pronounced.  I actually think it tasted a lot like the Stone Belgo IRS (the last iteration &#8211; not the current one spiced with Anise, which I find to be quite vile.)  In hindsight, I wish I would have bottled the majority of this batch to make it last longer &#8211; it was too easy to pour off 6 oz at a time from the tap for tastes &#8220;just to make sure it still tasted right.&#8221;  I&#8217;ll definitely brew this again &#8211; hopefully hitting my gravity marks &#8211; though I might ferment it a few degrees cooler, using a big starter rather than a yeast cake, which I think would make it more Odyssey-esque.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Those of us living in Philly are so lucky to have <a href="http://www.phillybeerweek.org/" target="_blank">Philly Beer Week</a> &#8211; an entire week-plus of events celebrating and sharing awesome beer.  I&#8217;ve been to several great events this week, having had the chance to try such rare gems as Mikkeller <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/13307/54211/?ba=mikey711" target="_blank">I Beat U</a>, Hill Farmstead <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/22511/69522/" target="_blank">Double Citra IPA</a>, several from Lost Abbey (Framboise de Amorosa, Cuvee de Tomme, Red Poppy, Amazing Grace, Veritas 008 &amp; 009, Duck Duck Gooze &amp; Its Pineapple-Guava variant), Russian River Supplication, North Coast Rasputin XII&#8230; this list could go on and on.  But the best Beer Week event I attended thus far was the Vegan Beer Dinner at <a href="http://memphistaproom.com/" target="_blank">Memphis Taproom</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I&#8217;ve been a huge fan of Memphis ever since it opened.  From day 1 they&#8217;ve made sure to include a plethora of vegan options on their menu &#8211; clearly marked.  I love when restaurants do this &#8211; it makes it feel so much more inviting to us vegans, and it avoids the awkward barrage of questions every visit.  Currently their dinner menu (it changes every few months) includes such delightfully awesome dishes as the smoked coconut club &amp; seitan shepherds pie, but in the past I&#8217;ve had things like jackfruit &#8220;crab cakes&#8221; and smoked avocado lettuce &amp; tomato sandwiches. Yums all around.  My only complaint about Memphis is that it is not in my neighborhood &#8211; so I usually have to run there (about 6 miles from my house, a good pre-brunch warmup) or take the subway.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/UgluMqD9N8QFwsp98zXzGg?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-h5nj4zsNbVQ/TfNjw88mMDI/AAAAAAAAAP4/cib_6lGCOtU/s400/IMG_1463.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align:center;"><em>Dan Shelton Rambling</em></div>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Truffled Beluga Lentils: Green Apple, Pickled Beet, Blood Orange, paired with Jolly Pumpkin La Roja</strong></p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-3N0u4vpBvwo/TfNjvvY7_mI/AAAAAAAAAP0/ftZAaKyRXiI/s400/IMG_1462.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align:left;">This might have been my favorite course of the night.  We learned during Dan Shelton&#8217;s long-winded &#8220;introduction speech&#8221; (he is the infamous Shelton Brothers beer importer/distributor) that Jolly Pumpkin owner &amp; head brewer Ron Jeffries is himself also vegan.  I&#8217;ve always been a fan of JP&#8217;s offerings and La Roja, a flanders style amber, is one of my favorites.  Tart, a little sweet, some nice tannins and not too much burning acetic character going on.  I&#8217;ve only had beluga lentils before at Horizons but I sure will pick some up in the future.  The sourness from the pickled beet &amp; the sweetness from the apple &amp; blood orange really made the flavors of both the lentils and the beer really pop.  Plus, anything served &#8220;truffled&#8221; makes me happy. <em> (Do yourself a favor and pick up some black truffle salt; you&#8217;ll thank me later.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Braised Carrot; Beer Battered Miso Tofu, Pea Shoots, Red Wine Chocolate Jus paired with De Ranke XX Bitter</strong></p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/_uAMFh8UrbRo05Q1RmTR_A?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-OSiuBDPXLzE/TfNjyIQijlI/AAAAAAAAAP8/o9yEKF_I0gE/s400/IMG_1464.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Memphis used to have beer battered miso tofu (&#8220;fish &amp; chips&#8221; style) on the menu, but its been ages since I&#8217;ve seen it.  This was an excellent opportunity to remind me of what I was missing.  Personally, I wasn&#8217;t in love with the red wine chocolate jus (I tend to not like combining chocolate with savory foods), but I devoured everything else you see on this plate.  Really enjoyed the XX Bitter as well &#8211; very aggressive hop-wise with a little more than a hint of classic (barnyard-y) brettanomyces.  Dan Shelton described the brett character as &#8220;what Orval <em>used</em> to be like.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Shitake and Leek Dumpling; Mushroom tea, ginger, black pepper oil, charred scallion paired with Mikkeller 10</strong></p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Jo4mZFZmzodSueoUhtaX_w?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-gPtNl0MaMW0/TfNjzcN4vRI/AAAAAAAAAQA/wfWEg-vwzGg/s400/IMG_1465.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">I could eat this soupy dish every day for the rest of my life and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d get sick of it.  All of the flavors here blended quite nicely.  Mikkeller 10 is a followup to their single hop ipa series; in this instance they added 10 different varieties throughout the boil.  Very fruity, a tad bit herbal, all around tasty.</p>
<p><strong>Dessert: Peche Mortel Poached Calimyrn Fig, Toasted Almond, Coffee Caramel, Popcorn Milk, paired with Du Ciel Peche Mo</strong>rtel</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/2XDcDfvAqA_jks1Db3Xo0g?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TavdGLKrr5M/TfNj1FofgUI/AAAAAAAAAQE/dELk-EgZdpQ/s400/IMG_1466.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">Personally, I&#8217;m not a huge fan of figs.  I don&#8217;t dislike figgy flavors in various dishes, or even in some big, complex beers like Belgian strong dark ales, but I don&#8217;t love biting into giant fig chunks.  Nonetheless, I licked this plate clean.  I do wish I asked how exactly &#8220;popcorn milk&#8221; is made, because I certainly want to try it again.  Peche Mortel was a great pairing here; it is one of the best coffee beers in the world (they use fair trade coffee in it, as well.)</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/jdwkym_MKIW4ndxwdJjvoQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1FLq-pAjxKw/TfNj2H2hq9I/AAAAAAAAAQI/a6h-sySYhJY/s400/IMG_1470.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align:center;"><em>Cheers for Chef Jesse Kimball (Phillies hat) &amp; his crew!</em></div>
<p><strong>Cheese Course: Aged Macadamia Cheese, Cashew &amp; Crystal Algae Blue Cheese, pickled blueberries, Smoked Coconut Marmalade paired with Spezial Rauchbier</strong></p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/hAOBTH4f4XUSmlvOZ95ZrA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-g2JXMRO3QYs/TfNj4Z_QDRI/AAAAAAAAAQQ/HTmmBL4RaKY/s400/IMG_1467.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">Even back before I was vegan, I was never a &#8220;cheese person&#8221; &#8211; the type of person to go to a wine party with various fancy cheeses that smell funny.  Semi-recently, though, I ordered <a href="http://www.dr-cow.com/">Dr Cow</a> nut cheese from pangea; it seemed interesting enough to try.  I&#8217;m not sure what happened &#8211; maybe it did not survive the trip from Maryland well, or maybe it sat in my fridge for too long, but it was dreadful.  This sampling (which <em>was</em> from Dr. Cow), on the other hand, was wonderful.  I enjoyed the texture and the taste, and the toasted bread sticks provided for spreading on were perfect.  The smoked coconut marmalade was great&#8230; But we already know Chef Jesse is the master at smoked coconut (see him on <a href="http://dinersdrive-insanddives.blogspot.com/2010/12/from-pork-to-tofu-dv1101h.html" target="_blank">Diners, Drive-ins and Dives</a>.)</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-fVl6VEmPc7s/TfNj3ryib8I/AAAAAAAAAQM/5Zp8U5ODGqk/s400/IMG_1471.jpg" alt="" width="299" height="400" /></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">And finally, no trip to Memphis is complete without using the rest room, and drying your hands with an xlerator &#8211; the only worthy hand dryer in the world.  I&#8217;m trying to figure out how to integrate one of these into my house.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In closing, this event was awesome.  The beer pairings were pretty spot on and the portions were just right. Our table of 5 left very satisfied!  Leigh from Memphis hinted that they will do it again next beer week &#8211; I can&#8217;t wait!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">I have a secret desire to be a hipster. Not really.  But if I was a hipster, I&#8217;d probably be eating bacon right now.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Anyway, last year on one of my annual visits to Albany, NY, Brett introduced me to the notion of coconut &#8220;bacon&#8221; &#8211; which he once had at <a href="http://www.auxvivres.com/en/home/">Aux Vivres</a>, a vegan restaurant in Montreal. Brett&#8217;s method of duplicating said food was a process of microwaving coconut flakes in a marinade for short periods of time, stirring, and repeating until it was done.  It was a trial-and-error process, but the results turned out great: Smokey, salty, crispy bacon chips.  After my success with the <a title="Just Tomatoes Bacon Bits" href="https://veganbrew.com/2010/11/01/just-tomatoes-bacon-bits/">Just Tomatoes Bacon Bits</a>, I wanted to try something similar, but pan-frying in oil instead.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/IlzQ9b17sLLs2Z8lxxgOQgh5I1p8xlJ4OnR8vwTQDts?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh6.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TPvWqkrUKnI/AAAAAAAAANQ/0ovuSAZWad4/s400/IMG_0460.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The most important ingredient? Coconut flakes.  Most places sell small shreds of coconut &#8211; these won&#8217;t really work.  You need something substantial.  I discovered that my local Whole Foods started selling these bags of sliced &amp; dehydrated coconut flakes for a few bucks.  Score.  Armed with some ideas from the Tempeh Bacon recipe in <a href="http://www.theppk.com/books/vegan-brunch/">Vegan Brunch</a> (my favorite cookbook), I was on my way.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Cc22kspkaMpv_K0jjBz3Xwh5I1p8xlJ4OnR8vwTQDts?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh6.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TPvWmwIPaGI/AAAAAAAAANE/VN4GB340QFU/s400/IMG_0459.JPG" alt="" width="299" height="400" /></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 cup of coconut flakes</li>
<li>3 tablespoons tamari (or soy sauce &#8211; I pretty much only buy tamari these days)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon of maple syrup</li>
<li>1 tablespoon of liquid smoke</li>
<li>freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
</ul>
<p>I mixed up the ingredients in a bowl, then stirred in the coconut flakes until they were mostly evenly coated.  I let this sit to soak for about 15 minutes.  I then dumped the bowl into a frying pan over medium-high heat.  At this point, there was a decent amount of extra liquid in the pan, so I was aiming to carmalize that up a bit.  You&#8217;ll need to watch this like a hawk &#8211; it can easily burn if you step away for any substantial amount of time.  I give the pan a good stir every minute or so to make sure all the flakes were cooking nicely.  As the flakes got crispier and darker, I lowered the heat (gradually) to prevent burning.  Feel free to sample a bit or two along the way to see how the taste is progressing.</p>
<p>I was left with a nice amount of slightly crispy, bacon-colored, oily goodness.  These come closest in texture and taste to what I remember as a bacon-eating kid compared to any other vegan analogues.  I paired them with the &#8220;Perfect Pancakes&#8221; from <a href="http://www.theppk.com/books/vegan-brunch/">Vegan Brunch</a> and have enough flakes left over to use as a topping in a seitan sandwich for later on in the day.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/TBJXbQ0oA68DRmmthc5jlwh5I1p8xlJ4OnR8vwTQDts?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh6.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TPvWoo8ccMI/AAAAAAAAANI/kkv-yVSXj-I/s640/IMG_0452.JPG" alt="" width="640" height="478" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Note: It looks like you can snag the coconut flakes I used on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lets-Do-Organic-Unsweetend-Coconut/dp/B000F4D5IU/">Amazon</a> fairly cheaply.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the <a title="Vegan in LA!" href="https://veganbrew.com/2010/11/11/vegan-in-la/">Los Angeles Vegan Beer Fest</a>, I had the awesome opportunity to try <a href="http://seabirdstruck.com">Searbirds</a>&#8216; beer-battered avocado tacos.  As a lover of tacos, of beer, and of avocado &#8211; this was a moment of sheer joy.  As someone who enjoys cooking &#8211; this was inspiration to try to do something similar myself.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/piXOZo7VtcdvXU06gpn50ELnzu_bgPI1luBULyjbriM?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh5.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBXMQQPprI/AAAAAAAAAKY/EJuJLdwu7Jw/s400/IMG_0293.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Given that avocados, when cut up, are somewhat slippery, I figured I needed a &#8220;more grippy&#8221; batter.  Usually, for beer batter, I use Isa&#8217;s recipe from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vegan-Brunch-Homestyle-Asparagus/dp/0738212725">Vegan Brunch</a>.  For this, I decided to make the batter more putty-like, less batter-like &#8211; the idea being that I could take gobs of it and mold it around the avocado slices.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/b2dh3UI4VJJ3feTIqO2dk0Lnzu_bgPI1luBULyjbriM?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh6.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBXB0P6GRI/AAAAAAAAAKA/7WGW9T8MW8I/s400/IMG_0269.JPG" alt="" width="299" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Beer Batter Ingredients</p>
<ul>
<li>1/2 Cup Flour</li>
<li>1/2 Cup Bread Crumbs (I used <a href="http://www2.kelloggs.com/ProductDetail.aspx?id=39">Corn Flake Crumbs</a>)</li>
<li>1/2 Cup Sly Fox <a href="http://www.slyfoxbeer.com/index.php/front/beer_pils">Pikeland Pils</a></li>
<li>2/3 Cup Water</li>
<li>1 Tablespoon corn starch</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ZeFNFL7Sjpd3l75TOOCcZkLnzu_bgPI1luBULyjbriM?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh5.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBXDm-WY3I/AAAAAAAAAKE/fa95uxfy1oM/s400/IMG_0272.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/h2XMMJS_52RJT9w0cfeBEkLnzu_bgPI1luBULyjbriM?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh4.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBXFG4vOZI/AAAAAAAAAKI/hrn4KqX-C6s/s400/IMG_0276.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/LHDS1ZnTyGUeEF5fA_J16ELnzu_bgPI1luBULyjbriM?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh4.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBXHEz3OeI/AAAAAAAAAKM/uVSESLiimow/s400/IMG_0277.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I took clumps of the &#8220;batter&#8221; and molded it to wrap around each avocado slice. I then rolled them in a separate bowl of bread crumbs to get the final later of crispy outside.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/PNbs9U2WfzFJkNJLvjJdGkLnzu_bgPI1luBULyjbriM?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh3.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBXIVlBAgI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/SYU5WPW9XHE/s400/IMG_0279.JPG" alt="" width="299" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I don&#8217;t have a deep fryer, so I simply pour a thin layer of canola oil into a nonstick pot and fry in that.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/1zMJ0Q5stXcyDh5PkohHbELnzu_bgPI1luBULyjbriM?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh5.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBXKO8gZlI/AAAAAAAAAKU/OFX-YOC4xpc/s400/IMG_0284.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">That&#8217;s it.  Simple!  In the first picture, I topped one of the tacos with <a href="http://www.chefdrew.com/Pages/products/dressings/dressings.html">Drew&#8217;s Smoked Tomato Dressing</a> and another with some salsa, stacking the avocado slices on top of a bed of chopped romaine lettuce.  I think these turned out pretty awesome.  My only complaint is that I am somewhat poor at picking out ripe avocados, so some of the pieces were not as buttery soft as I would have liked.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I completely winged Thanksgiving this year &#8211; literally hitting Whole Foods at 9am to pick up a myriad of groceries to use.  In the back of my mind, I knew I wanted to do some sort of seitan/soy roast, some mashed potatoes, and stuffing.  Vegan stuffing &#8211; even though it seems such a simple thing to make &#8211; is annoying in that Whole Foods&#8217; bags of stuffing are all full of meat flavoring.  I could go to a local supermarket and pick up some nutritionally junky hydrogenated-oily stuffing cubes, but I decided to just make my own with bread, using <a href="http://elizaveganpage.blogspot.com/2010/11/classic-sage-and-onion-stuffing.html">this recipe</a> I came across this week.</p>
<p>Anyway, here are some pictures and whatnot:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/uwrspUgJqLROhb3jFPylb2_JCVdRaKNnDTaU5HN7dks?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh6.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TO7U2F7f7mI/AAAAAAAAAMU/g3ZSmL5-9ys/s400/IMG_0365.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Garlic Mashed Potatoes from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Candle-Cafe-Cookbook-Enlightened-Restaurant/dp/0609809814">Candle Cafe Cookbook</a> (awesome cookbook, by the way)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/UtZ52lNBcmEPvcl1yB5pZm_JCVdRaKNnDTaU5HN7dks?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh5.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TO7U5lBk1qI/AAAAAAAAAMc/A_nPHgF7X8Y/s400/IMG_0368.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://elizaveganpage.blogspot.com/2010/11/classic-sage-and-onion-stuffing.html">Classic Sage &amp; Onion Stuffing</a>, from Elizavegan. I used a loaf of whole wheat bread from Whole Foods that was on sale for $2.  This turned out fracking <em>amazing</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/HfY81EavfvY5ev3qT8WBYm_JCVdRaKNnDTaU5HN7dks?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh4.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TO7U7tibVGI/AAAAAAAAAMg/rYvISGQfodA/s400/IMG_0370.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://macandcheesereview.blogspot.com/2010/02/soy-and-seitan-roast.html">Soy &amp; Seitan Roast</a> from Mac &amp; Cheese.  I wrapped the roast in yuba skin for the last 30 minutes of baking.  The texture and taste is pretty similar to a cross between Tofurky and the now-defunct Unturkey.  I find the amount of chickpea flour used in this recipe to be a tad overwhelming flavor-wise; I&#8217;d probably cut it with some other high-protein flour (maybe soy flour) in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">

<p style="text-align:left;">Spinach with Roasted Garlic Dressing from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Candle-Cafe-Cookbook-Enlightened-Restaurant/dp/0609809814">Candle Cafe Cookbook</a>.  In the future, I&#8217;d probably halve the amounts of vinegar used in this recipe, as I think it is too much (especially the balsamic.)</p>

<p>My plate of the roast, the mashed potatoes, stuffing, and extra yuba skin &#8211; topped with the gravy.</p>
<p>Happy Vegan Thanksgiving everyone!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When seeking vegan-friendly bars, I think I am pretty easy to please.  I basically require just a few simple things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Craft beer on tap</li>
<li>Vegan items clearly labeled on the menu, so I don&#8217;t have to play a game of 20 Questions with the waitstaff</li>
<li>More than 1 vegan choice, excluding hummus, &#8220;garden salads&#8221;, and portabello mushroom sandwiches. I&#8217;ve had enough of all three in my lifetime, thank you very much</li>
</ol>
<p>One particular chain of bar/restaurants in Philly always fulfills all three of those requirements.  I&#8217;m talking about the <a href="http://royaltavern.com">Royal Tavern</a> and both Cantina locations (<a href="http://www.cantinadossegundos.com/main.html">Dos Segundas</a> and <a href="http://www.cantinaloscaballitos.com/">Los Caballitos</a>.)  The head chef at all three locations, Mark McKinney, does a splendid job of giving us vegans a plethora of delicious menu options.  The recently revamped <a href="http://www.khyberpasspub.com/">Khyber Pass Pub</a> is the 4th, and possibly the best of the bunch in my humble opinion!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/vhlz_8PGLod9SzVAvgN56ZV0r66zNbIUMYpPdzWWyjk?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/lh6.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOymJXI05JI/AAAAAAAAALs/P022_efNIbg/s400/IMG_0348.JPG" alt="" width="299" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I strolled up to Old City this past Monday for an evening of food and drink at the Khyber.  The Khyber used to be primarily a music venue with a decent bar.  The first time I went there was more than a half-decade ago &#8211; to see Andy Rourke, formerly of The Smiths, spin records.  It happened to be the first time I tried a Victory Hop Devil; I deemed it too hoppy for my tastes at the time (oh, how the times have changed.)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The new Khyber has replaced the music floor with dining tables.  They now boast 20 tap lines and 2 hand pumps for cask-conditioned beer &#8211; everything from local favorites like Yards Philly Pale Ale or Victory Storm King to West Coast IPAs like Ballast Point Big Eye or Port Brewing High Tide.  And the food menu &#8211; still in &#8220;preview&#8221; mode for now, is Southern-style, with a bunch of vegan options.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Normally I&#8217;d go with seitan po boys or the veggie sausage sandwich &#8211; two mainstays on the still-new menu.  On this evening, however, I chose to start with one of the daily specials: Vegan Sausage &amp; Mustard Greens Soup.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/pJlTgO1TfU38g0vvBt6rUpV0r66zNbIUMYpPdzWWyjk?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/lh6.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOymF6nSl_I/AAAAAAAAALk/HxvMjrxgAO0/s400/IMG_0343.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The soup was very hearty and tasty.  The sausage reminded me of the vegan chorizo you can purchase at Whole Foods or Trader Joe&#8217;s.  The greens and tomato broth complimented it well.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">For my entree, I chose to go with the Vegan Pulled Pork Sandwich with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/7kYAHUv0F0Sn_uC_OMRVvZV0r66zNbIUMYpPdzWWyjk?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/lh5.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOymHZ2_T3I/AAAAAAAAALo/rKPflRoDUq4/s400/IMG_0346.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The mashed potatoes had a really raw (in a good way), un-processed feel to them.  As you can see by the crappy iPhone photo I took, it doesn&#8217;t look like the perfectly blended commercial junk you get in the supermarket.  This was a real mashup of potatoes and soy milk.  I think the gravy could be a tad thicker, but overall the taste was spot on (not overly salty, like some veg-gravies can be.)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The pulled pork sandwich itself was a soft bun surrounding a mound of slightly sweet but also tangy seitan covered in some sort of cole slaw.  I&#8217;m not a big cole slaw fan &#8211; in fact, I don&#8217;t like most white, veganaise-y things, but even I found this to be delicious.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I was too stuffed between the beer and food that I had no room for dessert.  They do offer cakes from <a href="http://www.vegantreats.com">Vegan Treats</a> in the event that I ever leave room in my stomach during a future visit.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Previously, my go-to, never-dissapoints, vegan-friendly Philly pubs were <a href="http://www.local44beerbar.com">Local 44</a> and <a href="http://www.memphistaproom.com">Memphis Taproom</a>, but I now have to make room for a third.  (It also helps that the Khyber Pass Pub is merely 2.5 miles away from my house, making for a pretty pleasant walk through Philadelphia.)  I highly recommend it to any vegans looking for hearty pub food and a few tasty pints.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think most vegans and vegetarians pretty much universally like seitan.  I find some, however, to be surprised when you tell them how easy it is to make.  Seitan can be both cheap and easy to craft in your own kitchen!</p>
<p>I have fond memories of the &#8220;Singing Cowboy&#8221; from Veggie Works in Belmar, NJ.  The centerpiece of that dish were large, thin slabs of perfectly breaded and fried seitan.  Friday night I came home from work and was in the mood to make something similar; here&#8217;s the process I took to pull that off.</p>
<p>A few upfront notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>This method of baking, not boiling, and using a nut butter for a fat source that also helps make these cutlets easily moldable, was inspired &amp; heavily influenced by Susan&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.fatfreevegan.com/2007/05/barbecued-seitan-ribz.html">Barbecued Seitan Ribz</a> over at <a href="http://blog.fatfreevegan.com/">FatFree Vegan Kitchen</a>.</li>
<li>I like using <a href="http://www2.kelloggs.com/ProductDetail.aspx?id=39">Corn Flake Crumbs</a> for the coating. I first tried these, I think, at <a href="http://www.foodswings.net">Foodswings</a> in Brooklyn several years ago.</li>
<li>I often use Trader Joe&#8217;s concentrated vegetable broth &#8211; they come in little  foil packets and are easy to drop into water, because I am pretty lazy.   The same product, non-TJ-labeled, can be found on Amazon.com <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Savory-Choice-Vegetable-Concentrate-4-2-Ounce/dp/B001E5E2B8/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1289773877&amp;sr=8-3">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 cup Vital Wheat Gluten</li>
<li>2 tablespoons nutritional yeast</li>
<li>3/4 cup vegetable broth</li>
<li>1 tablespoon tahini</li>
<li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/wrxFiGhF_ltONAlNDF8bmBGGSJWfjBTccV3ZS7P0hkY?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh4.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBZ_oEtXSI/AAAAAAAAALE/g-2Rm22ZYpA/s400/IMG_0261.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Combine the vital wheat gluten flour and the nutritional yeast</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/EjYecJ41e_I4b4e4kFd2rxGGSJWfjBTccV3ZS7P0hkY?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh5.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBiJNokcqI/AAAAAAAAALM/90Pof9jvmfc/s400/IMG_0260.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Step 2</strong>: Mix the broth, olive oil, and tahini. You could substitute another nut butter if you don&#8217;t have tahini.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/UTD6iM1dZIKCcT4GTy4ULRGGSJWfjBTccV3ZS7P0hkY?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh6.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBaDNv9NwI/AAAAAAAAALI/Z4zWli1iEvw/s400/IMG_0265.JPG" alt="" width="299" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Step 3</strong>: Mix the brothy mixture into the flour mixture.  Knead it a little bit with your hands briefly (around 30 seconds.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/4JrDzXRQJPa91LZ2S7n3-BGGSJWfjBTccV3ZS7P0hkY?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh5.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBXsBGMX7I/AAAAAAAAAKw/Hg3U56BFrYg/s400/IMG_0267.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Spray a glass dish with cooking spray.  Rip off chunks from the doughy mixture and flatten them out with your hands in the dish to the size and shape that you want. These aren&#8217;t going to shrink or expand much when cooking.  The pieces should be pretty easy to work with, and consistency-wise should feel more like something between paste and putty.  They will be somewhat fragile, but the baking will help firm this up.  Assuming your oven is up to temperature already, slide this in to begin baking.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/xHzT3pq3SLyAJyT7QUVT2xGGSJWfjBTccV3ZS7P0hkY?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/lh6.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBXzo63mYI/AAAAAAAAAK8/5WMzW2tveT4/s400/IMG_0281.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Step 5</strong>: After around 10 minutes, take them out to check on them. You want to be able to slide a spatula cleanly under them without the pieces sticking. This might take closer to 15 minutes, depending on your oven.  Flip the pieces over with a spatula.  The pieces should be glistening &#8211; not dry. If they look dry, add a little bit of broth (or some water with tamari or soy sauce.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/0dLkDSlWzPxLTsvCfImQZBGGSJWfjBTccV3ZS7P0hkY?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh3.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBXuI1GV9I/AAAAAAAAAK0/ZREHYbjljtE/s400/IMG_0273.JPG" alt="" width="299" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Step 6</strong>: After about 10 minutes, they should be ready. At this time you could sprinkle some seasonings on if you want.  I find thyme works well here.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">At this point, you could use them however you&#8217;d like &#8211; slice into strips for stir-fries, pile onto bread for a nice sandwich, or batter and fry them.  That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/pHnw4MGe9eblexsFY2QhDhGGSJWfjBTccV3ZS7P0hkY?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh4.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBXxhXVYDI/AAAAAAAAAK4/iuhmWoa5FJE/s400/IMG_0276.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong>: To batter these, I use a simple process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dip into a bowl of plain flour</li>
<li>Dip into a bowl of water</li>
<li>Transfer into bowl of bread crumbs, coating evenly</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong>: Fry them. I won&#8217;t go into details here; I usually fill a stockpot with some vegetable oil and just drop the pieces in, flipping them when they get golden-brown.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/8hQqtNvbAwzXz-uQehrpQRGGSJWfjBTccV3ZS7P0hkY?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh3.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TOBX1FNmcRI/AAAAAAAAALA/nb6QMPGOaIc/s400/IMG_0291.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Typically I&#8217;ll consume these with stuffing, or mashed potatoes and gravy.  Friday night I was hungry, so I just ate them as is on a plate, with a light sprinkling of truffle salt on top.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, somewhat on a short-scheduled whim, I decided to visit Los Angeles.  I&#8217;ve only been California once before in my life (San Francisco) and don&#8217;t travel too often. But I&#8217;ve been drooling over the pictures &amp; reviews that <a href="http://quarrygirl.com">quarrygirl</a> has been posting for a while now &#8211; and when she decided to put together a <strong><a href="http://losangelesvegan.com/">Vegan Beer Fest</a></strong> &#8211; complete with food &amp; bands, I found the perfect excuse for a trip.</p>
<p>I left work early last Thursday, catching an early evening flight from Philly which would put me in LA around 9. Upon arriving &amp; getting my rental car, I hit my trusty <a href="http://developer.palm.com/appredirect/?packageid=com.mudrick.veginout">HappyCow VeginOut Guide</a> app to see what was near the Airport and still open. VeggieGrill was the winner!  <em>Side note: I wrote the app, it is available for Palm webOS devices (Pre &amp; Pixi) and will use gps to find nearby veg eateries.</em></p>
<h2>Day 0: VeggieGrill</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.veggiegrill.com">VeggieGrill</a> is nothing sort of amazing.  An all-vegan fast food chain in California (4 locations with a 5th coming soon), the menu (affordable wraps, burgers, salads, soups) is precisely something we&#8217;re lacking here in Philly. The space is bright &amp; clean, the employees were super-friendly, and they also serve beer and wine.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Chill Out Wings by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5153870865/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4057/5153870865_a8be4e5268.jpg" alt="Chill Out Wings" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">First up, I had the Chill Out Wings. These are about a half-dozen seitan tenders in a slightly flakey batter, served with tangy BBQ sauce and a mild-tasting white sauce.  They reminded me somewhat of the Tender Tiger from <a href="http://www.verticaldiner.com">Vertical Diner</a> in Salt Lake City. I&#8217;m not a huge fan of ranch / vegenaise types of sauces (though they are growing on me, slowly) but the blend of these two sauces made for a very flavorful appetizer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="All American Stack by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5154473182/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4005/5154473182_c201d10c9a.jpg" alt="All American Stack" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">My main course was the All-American Stack: grilled veggie steak, thousand island dressing, pickles, lettuce, tomato &#8211; topped with onion rings on a wheat bun. The sandwiches &amp; burgers at VeggieGrill come with cabbage slaw or chili as a side, but I opted to upgrade to the Steamin&#8217; Kale.  This sandwich was mighty tasty &#8211; a combination of things I would have never thought to compile on one bun, but it worked well. I wasn&#8217;t a huge fan of the kale, but that&#8217;s mostly my fault &#8211; it comes topped with a ginger-miso dressing, and I kind of sort of hate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger_Kids">ginger</a>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;">Day 1: Sightseeing</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">On Friday, after an early morning 6 mile run through Beverly Hills (which was a few blocks east of where I was staying),  I decided to haphazardly hop in my rental car and see some sights. Most people would, say, go to a museum, or some park or monument. Me? I wanted to geek out on some TV-land stuff. First up: the city of Torrance.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Torrance High School by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5166941581/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4016/5166941581_9ca60cca0f.jpg" alt="Torrance High School" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This is Torrance High School. Why is <em>this</em> a worthy sight you ask? Well, the exteriors for lots of high school tv shows &amp; movies were shot here. Amongst the ones I care about: She&#8217;s All That, Beverly Hills 90210, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  I drove around the back &#8211; which had better, more memory-jogging visuals, but decided not to take any pictures of that, on account of trying to not look like a creepo taking pictures of high school kids.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Buffy's House by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5167557552/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4065/5167557552_3cc1456541.jpg" alt="Buffy's House" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Just a few blocks away from the high school&#8230; Buffy Summers&#8217; house!  Exteriors for Buffy&#8217;s house were shot here. Call me a dork, but I found this to be very.. cool.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;">The Spot</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">Hunger was getting the best of me, so I decided to head towards the coastline and take a little trip to Hermosa Beach. When my wife visited LA a few years back, she raved about the food at <a href="http://www.worldfamousspot.com/">The Spot</a>, especially the Tofu Savory Sauce.  <em>Note: the recipe can be found <a href="http://www.food.com/recipe/creamy-tofu-savory-sauce-277729">here</a>; it is pretty spot-on. Hah!</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Savory Spud by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5153882711/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4007/5153882711_191348481a.jpg" alt="Savory Spud" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I opted for the Savory Spud &#8211; a huge potato, topped with veggies, tempeh, and the savory sauce. This was a beast of a meal &#8211; very filling &#8211; and very tasty. I found the seasoning on the tempeh to be a little oft-putting (perhaps it was too much cumin?) &#8211; but overall, thumbs up.  I paired this dish with an organic <a href="http://bisonbrew.com/product/organic-ipa-pale-ale">Bison IPA</a>, which worked well.  After filling my stomach, I hopped back in the car, turned north and drove to Venice Beach.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="MacGyver's Season 1 House by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5167561880/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4017/5167561880_e22a2b5e84.jpg" alt="MacGyver's Season 1 House" width="374" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Venice Beach is a weird place. <em>Really</em> weird. The house above was MacGyver&#8217;s season 1 residence (it is now a law firm.) I was too early for the Green Flash Happy Hour at the Venice Ale House, so I decided to just walk around. Wow! Venice Beach is a generally pleasant place, but it was filled with hippies, gypsies, people selling all sorts of crappy art, junky rocks, etc. I even saw someone selling twigs labeled as &#8220;magic wands.&#8221; I witnessed the police rolling up onto the boardwalk (well, really a paved path along the beachfront) to stop some sort of food fight. I also passed one of those &#8220;come in, let&#8217;s diagnose your achy knee and get you some weed!&#8221; cannibus clubs &#8211; which just seemed and felt weird.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Whole Foods Vegan Taqueria by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5167566142/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4089/5167566142_a2e04eb6e4.jpg" alt="Whole Foods Vegan Taqueria" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">On my way back to LA from Venice, I stopped in at the Venice Whole Foods. I always like visiting Whole Foods in other cities &#8211; always hopeful that I&#8217;m going to come across some crazy local or regional vegan product or food that I can&#8217;t get back home.  Brett and I once spent close to two hours combing every aisle of a Whole Foods in Boston! I bought no food, but I got a picture of their Vegan Taqueria sign, which seemed pretty cool. I also picked up a bottle of <a href="http://www.lostabbey.com/beer-release-older-viscosity-2010/">Lost Abbey Older Viscosity</a> for sampling later that night. It is liberating to purchase craft beer in your supermarkets; I look forward to the day when this is the norm in Pennsylvania. Older Viscosity is one of my favorite barrel-aged beers; a blend of a hybrid stout/barleywine aged in Bourbon barrels for 1 year. It was the perfect beer to gently coax me into sleep that night.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;">Day 2: Vegan Beer Fest</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">I purposefully skipped dinner Friday night, knowing that I needed to prepare space for the food and beer I was going to consume on Saturday. Saturday started with a very hilly 10 mile run through Beverly Hills, Brentwood, Westwood and other surrounding areas, then a walk up to Sunset Boulevard for the Fest.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="The Roxy by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5153619732/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm2.static.flickr.com/1354/5153619732_feda41b3f3.jpg" alt="The Roxy" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I was excited, but also nervous at the same time, on account of never having actually met any of the LA vegans I follow &amp; interact with on Twitter. I&#8217;ve been to at least a half-dozen beer fests in the past few years and this ended up being <strong>my favorite</strong> out of all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Vegan Beer Fest Glass by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5167766166/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4002/5167766166_8da25375d9.jpg" alt="Vegan Beer Fest Glass" width="374" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The fest was at the Roxy Theatre on Sunset in West Hollywood. It is apparently a somewhat famous club and has hosted a ridiculous amount of famous bands &amp; comedians over the years. VIP ticket holders were treated to an hour pre-fest of beer in the upstairs bar, called <em>On the Rox</em>. This is the very bar where John Belushi apparently partied the night he fatally od&#8217;ed. At the bar they were pouring a few beers from Maui Brewing, and a triple IPA from SpeakEasy called The Don. Potent at 11%, but deliciously incorporating several of my favorite hops (Summit, Centennial, Amarillo) &#8211; this was a winner.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">There were several LA-area food trucks serving food at the fest: <a href="http://thefrankenstand.blogspot.com/">The Frankenstand</a> (vegan sausage cart), <a href="http://twitter.com/yallatruck">Yalla Truck</a> (falafel), <a href="http://www.freshfries.biz">Fresh Fries</a>, <a href="www.mandolinegrill.com/">Mandoline Grill</a> (Vietnamese), <a href="http://seabirdstruck.com/">SeaBirds</a> (vegan burgers/tacos/burritos), and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/doomieshomecookin">Doomie&#8217;s Home Cookin</a>. I sampled from 4 of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Beer Battered Avocado Taco by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5153017709/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/5153017709_d6f21deb6c.jpg" alt="Beer Battered Avocado Taco" width="374" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The first dish I helped myself to was the Beer-battered avocado tacos from Seabirds.  I&#8217;m not sure if words can properly describe how awesome these were. The avocado pieces melted in your mouth as you bit in. Simply put: these were amazing. In fact, I showed this picture to one of my Philly friends when I got back, who happens to be a huge foodie &amp; server at some of the top notch eateries in town. He was so impressed that he turned around and showed it to one of his chefs, who has interest in trying to do something similar. I know <em>I</em> certainly will be trying to make something similar soon!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Jerk Jackfruit Taco by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5153632500/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm2.static.flickr.com/1327/5153632500_fb75e4576d.jpg" alt="Jerk Jackfruit Taco" width="374" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Seabirds also had a Jerk Jackfruit taco which was pretty high on the awesome scale. If you aren&#8217;t familiar, Jackfruit is a very &#8220;fleshy&#8221; fruit. The Memphis Taproom, in Philly (my favorite vegan friendly bar in the world) &#8211; has jackfruit &#8220;crab&#8221; cakes which are great too. If you see vegan jackfruit based dishes, don&#8217;t hesitate to give it a try!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Jalapeno Poppers &amp; Buffalo Legs by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5153022061/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm2.static.flickr.com/1351/5153022061_61aa152947.jpg" alt="Jalapeno Poppers &amp; Buffalo Legs" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Doomie&#8217;s stepped up with jalapeno poppers and hot &#8220;chicken legs.&#8221;  I&#8217;ve actually never had jalapeno poppers before in my life, so my comparison baseline is nonexistent, but these were great &#8211; hot, crispy, and oozing with saucy cheezy goodness inside.  The legs were solid &#8211; I certainly wouldn&#8217;t refuse them, but I suspect they were <a href="http://www.vegieworld.com/cart/product_pages.asp?id=540">May Wah based</a>, so they&#8217;re pretty standard to the wing-type offerings that most cities have.  Doomie&#8217;s also had cupcakes topped with icing that utilized Maui Brewing Coconut Porter.  I did not get a chance to try them, but I wish I had.  I saw many people chomping down on the chocolate covered &#8220;bacon&#8221; they had &#8211; I skipped it because the combination didn&#8217;t really appeal to me.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Vampire Repellent (Garlic Fries) by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5153641078/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4024/5153641078_98a09dfc1d.jpg" alt="Vampire Repellent (Garlic Fries)" width="374" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The only other food I sampled were the &#8220;Vampire Repellant&#8221; fries from Fresh Fries. They were topped with minced garlic.  This combination was very tasty, but i was pretty full at this point.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I had hoped to chronicle each and every beer I tried, but that gets tedious after approximately 1 beer.  I mostly sought out stuff I couldn&#8217;t get back home.  Without question, the beer I was most blown away by was <a href="http://eaglerockbrewery.com/group/solidarityblackmild">Eagle Rock Solidarity Black Mild</a>.  I&#8217;m always intrigued by full-flavored session beers, and this was no exception. Malty, roasty, and under 4% ABV; I wish more breweries did styles like this.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I departed the fest very full, buzzed but not drunk, and overall very happy. It was a very well-behaved fest, full of friendly people chilling out.  Having such an array of awesome food was such a welcome change for those of us who resort to eating like birds at most beer festivals. I slept like a baby Saturday night.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;">Day 3: Madeleine Bistro</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">I woke up Sunday well-rested and looking for more epic food adventures.  After a quick 4 mile run to get my juices flowing, it was off to <a href="http://www.madeleinebistro.com/">Madeleine Bistro</a> &#8211; the area&#8217;s premier upscale vegan eatery. The one negative off the bat: the restaurant is in San Fernando Valley (is this the geographical container for the females that Frank Zappa spoke of in &#8220;Valley Girl&#8221;?) which is a bit of a haul. Luckily the freeway was pretty clear on this Sunday morning.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Caeser Salad by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5167571260/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4038/5167571260_2e7f998955.jpg" alt="Caeser Salad" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I started with the caesar salad.  I&#8217;m a firm believer that this dish is a good indicator of how good a vegan establishment is. This salad was simple, but good (no complaints.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Fried Seitan, Waffles &amp; Mashed Potatoes by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5167578408/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm2.static.flickr.com/1206/5167578408_a875c14e7c.jpg" alt="Fried Seitan, Waffles &amp; Mashed Potatoes" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Next up: Chicken-fried seitan over mashed potatoes with waffles. This was a home run, folks. I was a fan of the beer battered seitan and waffles that are available in Philly at <a href="http://www.milahvegetarian.com/">Mi Lah</a>&#8216;s weekend brunch, but this particular dish blows that away. The seitan itself reminded me of of the cutlets that came in the &#8220;Singing Cowboy&#8221; at the no-longer-existing Veggie Works &#8211; certainly doable at home with some practice &#8211; but hard to make consistently good. The seasoning &amp; spices in the coating were superb.  I do, however have two complaints with regards to this dish: the waffles crumbled too easily (literally fell apart when I cut off a piece to eat) and there should have been 2 pieces of seitan.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Cheesecake by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5166983151/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4087/5166983151_8244903145.jpg" alt="Cheesecake" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">At this point I was fairly full, but still wanted to try more food.  I decided to order a slice of the cheesecake, and a donut. I cannot possibly describe the look of disgust that my waitress gave me as I ordered these additional items to stuff into myself.  The cheesecake was solid but not spectacular.  I&#8217;m a huge fan of <a href="http://www.vegantreats.com/">Vegan Treats</a>, which can be found all over the place locally, and I think they do a better cheesecake (not to mention, they make literally dozens of different flavors/types.)  The $12 price point for a slice is mildly absurd too.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I took the donut to go and ended up eating it later that night.  Though it was not a traditionally-shaped hole-in-middle type, I still devoured it and enjoyed it enough to declare it the best vegan donut I&#8217;ve ever consumed.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">After waddling back to the car and heading back to LA, I met up with the <a href="http://quarrygirl.com">quarrygirl</a> gang to check out <a href="http://www.tonysda.com/">Tony&#8217;s Darts Away</a>, a draft-only beer bar in Burbank. Still full from the brunch, I didn&#8217;t get to try some of their vegan specialties (like their sausages.)  I did, however, enjoy a few tasty adult beverages (2008 Stone IRS, Port Brewing Mongo IPA, and Stone Belgo Stout) which were all served well &amp; proper.  The Belgo Stout actually reminded me a lot of the oak-aged Belgian Imperial Wheat Stout that I brewed this year (which means I should probably post that recipe in the near future.)</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;">VeggieGrill</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">Eventually I got hungry again (this happens every 2 hours or so for me.)  While waiting for The Surly Goat to open, I walked up to VeggieGrill&#8217;s location on Sunset for some grub.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Blackened Chicken Caeser Wrap w/ Mac &amp; Cheese by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5167597390/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm2.static.flickr.com/1438/5167597390_c01cbbafc2.jpg" alt="Blackened Chicken Caeser Wrap w/ Mac &amp; Cheese" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I went with the chick&#8217;n caesar wrap with a side of mac-and-cheese. Undoubtedly, this was the best wrap I&#8217;ve had in my life. The mac-and-cheese was very good, though a tad bit on the sweet side.  Bonus: VeggieGrill CEO Kevin Boylan was walking around handing out free cookies to all patrons as a thank you for visiting. <strong>Awesome!</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;">The Surly Goat</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">After my meal I walked back to The Surly Goat, a West Hollywood beer bar.  Besides having the most awesome bar name ever, I was blown away by the beer offerings.  Immediately I knew I was in trouble: there was just too much to sample and I just <em>had</em> to try as much as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Lost Abbey Red Poppy by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5167529326/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4027/5167529326_971655f9aa.jpg" alt="Lost Abbey Red Poppy" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Red Poppy, from Lost Abbey, is one of my favorite sour beers.  It is a Flanders Brown (oud bruin) aged on sour cherries &amp; an extreme rarity in Philly.  If you like sour, funky beers, this is a must try.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Lost Abbey Cuvee de Tomme by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5167533504/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm2.static.flickr.com/1390/5167533504_8ef9505628.jpg" alt="Lost Abbey Cuvee de Tomme" width="374" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I also saw Lost Abbey&#8217;s Cuvee de Tomme on the bottle list.  This beer is an 11% Belgian Brown Ale aged on sour cherries in a Brett-innoculated bourbon barrels. It is truly a one of a kind beer (it is usually very tough for beers that high in alcohol to sour this dramatically.)  I had it once before: Brett &amp; I split a 375mL bottle last year.  Unfortunately this was a 750mL bottle.  Though I shared some with the bartenders, this proved to be the last beer I could handle for the evening.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;">Day 4: M Cafe</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">Before heading back to the airport for my return voyage, I hit up M Cafe in Beverly Hills for some brunch.  M Cafe is an interesting place. Given the emphasis on macrobiotic offerings, I originally mistook it for being all-vegan, until I realized half the menu contain fish, which is somewhat of a bummer. Nonetheless, it is worth visting &#8211; it is clean, fresh &amp; good &#8211; reminding me somewhat of the now-defunct NYC eatery, Bachue (a former favorite of mine.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Breakfast Burrito by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5167607390/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4064/5167607390_17494e050a.jpg" alt="Breakfast Burrito" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I ordered the breakfast burrito with an avocado addition.  The brown rice wrap bundled up an inviting mixture of tofu, black beans, brown rice, kale, &amp; vegan cheddar cheese.  It came with a side of a spicy chipotle sauce, which had a very citrusy element to it and really helped the flavors of the burrito to pop.  For my final meal in Los Angeles, this really hit the spot.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Los Angeles was a blast. The weather was pleasant, the palm trees were plentiful, I made some new friends and got to sample &amp; savour a ton of awesome food and beer.  I look forward to returning some day!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here we are: our first entry as first-timers in <a href="http://veganmofo.wordpress.com">Vegan MoFo</a> and personally <em>my</em> first post in a long while (Brett is the far better brewer and food-creator.)</p>
<p>This weekend I was making some vegan beer chili (we&#8217;ll cover this later in the week) and wanted to add a little something to punch up the flavor. Lots of chili recipes tend to include bacon, and I had no suitable bacon replacements in the house. Scanning my shelf o&#8217; goodies, I spotted a small tub of <a href="http://www.justtomatoes.com/jtstore/pc/Organic-Just-Tomato-Bits-2p120.htm">Organic Just Tomatoes Bits</a> that I have not used in a while. If you are not familiar with their products &#8211; they essentially have a whole line of tubs full of dried fruits &amp; vegetables. You can find them at pretty much any co-op or natural foods store.  I figured I&#8217;d experiment to see how they&#8217;d turn out if I bacon-bit-ized a scoop full of them to add to the chili.</p>
<h2>Just Tomatoes Bacon Bits</h2>
<ul>
<li>1/2 C Just Tomatoes Bits</li>
<li>1 tsp high quality extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>1 tbs liquid smoke</li>
<li>1 tsp tamari</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Smoked Tomato &quot;Bacon&quot; Bits in the Pan (Start) by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5137953834/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm2.static.flickr.com/1152/5137953834_5294fd3daf.jpg" alt="Smoked Tomato &quot;Bacon&quot; Bits in the Pan (Start)" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Simple instructions: Add the olive oil to a pan over medium heat; Add  Just Tomatoes Bits so they are coated well in the oil (lots of  stirring); Add the liquid smoke and tamari almost immediately. The key  is to keep an eye on it and stir often. They can easily burn if you get lazy (obviously I learned that lesson the hard way.)  It only takes a few minutes (5 for me; will vary depending on your cookware &amp; stovetop.)  I was looking to brown the bits &#8211; but <em>not</em> make crispy.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a title="Smoked Tomato &quot;Bacon&quot; Bits in the Pan (End) by kmudrick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31796525@N08/5137348685/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4071/5137348685_faf2262789.jpg" alt="Smoked Tomato &quot;Bacon&quot; Bits in the Pan (End)" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Add some more oil if you desire &#8211; I think it can only help give it a bit of &#8220;greasiness.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">I thought these turned out pretty awesome. They ended up giving the chili an extra oomph I was looking for, though I wish I had made &amp; added more to that.  I can see other uses in the future too &#8211; these would be perfect as a topping on some Sunday brunch tofu scramble as an alternative to the tempeh bacon we&#8217;re all too often accustomed to.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">I have a secret desire to be a hipster. Not really.  But if I was a hipster, I&#8217;d probably be eating bacon right now.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Anyway, last year on one of my annual visits to Albany, NY, Brett introduced me to the notion of coconut &#8220;bacon&#8221; &#8211; which he once had at <a href="http://www.auxvivres.com/en/home/">Aux Vivres</a>, a vegan restaurant in Montreal. Brett&#8217;s method of duplicating said food was a process of microwaving coconut flakes in a marinade for short periods of time, stirring, and repeating until it was done.  It was a trial-and-error process, but the results turned out great: Smokey, salty, crispy bacon chips.  After my success with the <a title="Just Tomatoes Bacon Bits" href="https://veganbrew.com/2010/11/01/just-tomatoes-bacon-bits/">Just Tomatoes Bacon Bits</a>, I wanted to try something similar, but pan-frying in oil instead.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/IlzQ9b17sLLs2Z8lxxgOQgh5I1p8xlJ4OnR8vwTQDts?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh6.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TPvWqkrUKnI/AAAAAAAAANQ/0ovuSAZWad4/s400/IMG_0460.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The most important ingredient? Coconut flakes.  Most places sell small shreds of coconut &#8211; these won&#8217;t really work.  You need something substantial.  I discovered that my local Whole Foods started selling these bags of sliced &amp; dehydrated coconut flakes for a few bucks.  Score.  Armed with some ideas from the Tempeh Bacon recipe in <a href="http://www.theppk.com/books/vegan-brunch/">Vegan Brunch</a> (my favorite cookbook), I was on my way.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Cc22kspkaMpv_K0jjBz3Xwh5I1p8xlJ4OnR8vwTQDts?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh6.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TPvWmwIPaGI/AAAAAAAAANE/VN4GB340QFU/s400/IMG_0459.JPG" alt="" width="299" height="400" /></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 cup of coconut flakes</li>
<li>3 tablespoons tamari (or soy sauce &#8211; I pretty much only buy tamari these days)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon of maple syrup</li>
<li>1 tablespoon of liquid smoke</li>
<li>freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
</ul>
<p>I mixed up the ingredients in a bowl, then stirred in the coconut flakes until they were mostly evenly coated.  I let this sit to soak for about 15 minutes.  I then dumped the bowl into a frying pan over medium-high heat.  At this point, there was a decent amount of extra liquid in the pan, so I was aiming to carmalize that up a bit.  You&#8217;ll need to watch this like a hawk &#8211; it can easily burn if you step away for any substantial amount of time.  I give the pan a good stir every minute or so to make sure all the flakes were cooking nicely.  As the flakes got crispier and darker, I lowered the heat (gradually) to prevent burning.  Feel free to sample a bit or two along the way to see how the taste is progressing.</p>
<p>I was left with a nice amount of slightly crispy, bacon-colored, oily goodness.  These come closest in texture and taste to what I remember as a bacon-eating kid compared to any other vegan analogues.  I paired them with the &#8220;Perfect Pancakes&#8221; from <a href="http://www.theppk.com/books/vegan-brunch/">Vegan Brunch</a> and have enough flakes left over to use as a topping in a seitan sandwich for later on in the day.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/TBJXbQ0oA68DRmmthc5jlwh5I1p8xlJ4OnR8vwTQDts?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh6.ggpht.com/_6svlLAhsaic/TPvWoo8ccMI/AAAAAAAAANI/kkv-yVSXj-I/s640/IMG_0452.JPG" alt="" width="640" height="478" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Note: It looks like you can snag the coconut flakes I used on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lets-Do-Organic-Unsweetend-Coconut/dp/B000F4D5IU/">Amazon</a> fairly cheaply.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Onto the last entry for <a href="http://veganmofo.wordpress.com/">Vegan Mofo</a>. It&#8217;s been a lot of fun and definitely a motivator for Kev and I to keep the blog updated. We&#8217;ll try not to let the momentum die off, keeping these updates coming often.</p>
<p>Recently a vegetarian friend of mine, who has been on a long quest for a good alternative to bacon, passed on a recipe for shiitake mushroom &#8220;bacon&#8221; that she had picked up from a graduate from the <a href="http://www.naturalgourmetschool.com/">Natural Gourmet Institute. </a>I was a bit skeptical when she told me it only involved salt, olive oil and shiitakes. No liquid smoke?? Well, after a quick search on the google I found <a href="http://www.sciencentral.com/video/2009/03/02/make-mushrooms-taste-like-bacon/">this</a> recipe and instructional video from a chef at the Natural Gourmet Institute. Perfect. I made the bacon, following the instructions on the site. I had to cook a bit longer (about an hour) and could have actually gone a bit longer, as the crispier pieces came out more bacon like. Here are the shiitakes before and after baconizing:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Shiitake Bacon" src="http://images5a.snapfish.com/232323232%7Ffp63387%3Enu%3D328%3A%3E%3A96%3E%3B%3A6%3EWSNRCG%3D357232675%3A32%3Cnu0mrj" alt="" width="371" height="480" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I wouldn&#8217;t say you are going to fool an omnivore with this recipe, but no doubt, the &#8220;bacon&#8221; has an awesome salty and savory flavor, with a greasy touch that makes for a good substitute. There&#8217;s even a bit of smokeyness in the pieces that got a little blackened. Extremely flavorful and relatively simple.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I had some Brussels sprouts leftover from the <a href="https://veganbrew.com/2010/11/04/veganized-vlaamse-stoofkarbonaden-belgian-beef-stew/">harvest</a> that I had stored in the freezer, which seemed like a good match for the bacon. I also had a bottle of <a href="http://www.leffe.com/en/beer/leffe-blond">Leffe Blond</a> in the fridge (purchased with a friend on a 4 am drunken stroll through Manhattan last weekend, after closing <a href="http://www.gingerman-ny.com/">The Ginger Man</a>), so I decided to braise the thawed sprouts in 1/2 cup of Leffe Blond for about 10 minutes (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_sprout#Cooking_and_preparation">avoid overcooking</a>), then sprinkled them with some smoked salt and smoked black pepper.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Beer Braised Brussels Sprouts" src="http://images2.snapfish.com/232323232%7Ffp538%3A9%3Enu%3D328%3A%3E%3A96%3E%3B%3A6%3EWSNRCG%3D356%3B%3C%3A727%3A32%3Cnu0mrj" alt="" width="480" height="360" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Most of the beer was absorbed by the sprouts, which gave them a caramelized sweetness. This sweetness complimented the salty &#8220;bacon&#8221; perfectly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Brussels Sprouts and Shiitake Bacon" src="http://images5a.snapfish.com/232323232%7Ffp6338%3B%3Enu%3D328%3A%3E%3A96%3E%3B%3A6%3EWSNRCG%3D356%3B%3C%3A728332%3Cnu0mrj" alt="" width="360" height="480" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">To round out the meal, I decided to make quinoa. I chose quinoa mostly because it acted as the protein for the dish, but also because I&#8217;ve been meaning to try to make it in my <a href="http://www.zojirushi.com/ourproducts/ricecookers/np_hbc.html">Zojirushi rice cooker</a>. I&#8217;ve read that quinoa can be made in it exactly as you would make white rice. I set it to medium hard white rice and it was ready &#8211; evenly cooked and delicious &#8211; in about 20 minutes. To add a bit more flavor, I made a pilaf with the cooked quinoa.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">To make the pilaf, toast 1/2 cup of sliced almonds (I used almonds that were coated with maple and cayenne) and set aside. Then, saute 2-3 cloves of crushed garlic in 1/4 cup of olive oil. Add 3 cups cooked quinoa. Stir for a few minutes, then add 1 teaspoon of fresh thyme and 1 tablespoon of cumin. Mix in the almonds and 1/4 cup of raisins or currants. Finally, mix in 1 tablespoon <a href="http://www.bragg.com/products/la.html">Bragg&#8217;s liquid aminos</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Shiitake Bacon Brussels Sprouts and Qunioa Pilaf" src="http://images5a.snapfish.com/232323232%7Ffp63389%3Enu%3D328%3A%3E%3A96%3E%3B%3A6%3EWSNRCG%3D356%3B%3C%3A6%3A6332%3Cnu0mrj" alt="" width="360" height="480" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This was relatively easy to make and was bursting with flavor. Sweet, salty, savory and even a touch of spice from the cayenne coating on the almonds. All this went well with the peppery flavors in the Leffe. I will definitely be making this one again soon!</p>

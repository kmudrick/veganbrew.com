										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Those of us living in Philly are so lucky to have <a href="http://www.phillybeerweek.org/" target="_blank">Philly Beer Week</a> &#8211; an entire week-plus of events celebrating and sharing awesome beer.  I&#8217;ve been to several great events this week, having had the chance to try such rare gems as Mikkeller <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/13307/54211/?ba=mikey711" target="_blank">I Beat U</a>, Hill Farmstead <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/22511/69522/" target="_blank">Double Citra IPA</a>, several from Lost Abbey (Framboise de Amorosa, Cuvee de Tomme, Red Poppy, Amazing Grace, Veritas 008 &amp; 009, Duck Duck Gooze &amp; Its Pineapple-Guava variant), Russian River Supplication, North Coast Rasputin XII&#8230; this list could go on and on.  But the best Beer Week event I attended thus far was the Vegan Beer Dinner at <a href="http://memphistaproom.com/" target="_blank">Memphis Taproom</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I&#8217;ve been a huge fan of Memphis ever since it opened.  From day 1 they&#8217;ve made sure to include a plethora of vegan options on their menu &#8211; clearly marked.  I love when restaurants do this &#8211; it makes it feel so much more inviting to us vegans, and it avoids the awkward barrage of questions every visit.  Currently their dinner menu (it changes every few months) includes such delightfully awesome dishes as the smoked coconut club &amp; seitan shepherds pie, but in the past I&#8217;ve had things like jackfruit &#8220;crab cakes&#8221; and smoked avocado lettuce &amp; tomato sandwiches. Yums all around.  My only complaint about Memphis is that it is not in my neighborhood &#8211; so I usually have to run there (about 6 miles from my house, a good pre-brunch warmup) or take the subway.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/UgluMqD9N8QFwsp98zXzGg?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-h5nj4zsNbVQ/TfNjw88mMDI/AAAAAAAAAP4/cib_6lGCOtU/s400/IMG_1463.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align:center;"><em>Dan Shelton Rambling</em></div>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Truffled Beluga Lentils: Green Apple, Pickled Beet, Blood Orange, paired with Jolly Pumpkin La Roja</strong></p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-3N0u4vpBvwo/TfNjvvY7_mI/AAAAAAAAAP0/ftZAaKyRXiI/s400/IMG_1462.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align:left;">This might have been my favorite course of the night.  We learned during Dan Shelton&#8217;s long-winded &#8220;introduction speech&#8221; (he is the infamous Shelton Brothers beer importer/distributor) that Jolly Pumpkin owner &amp; head brewer Ron Jeffries is himself also vegan.  I&#8217;ve always been a fan of JP&#8217;s offerings and La Roja, a flanders style amber, is one of my favorites.  Tart, a little sweet, some nice tannins and not too much burning acetic character going on.  I&#8217;ve only had beluga lentils before at Horizons but I sure will pick some up in the future.  The sourness from the pickled beet &amp; the sweetness from the apple &amp; blood orange really made the flavors of both the lentils and the beer really pop.  Plus, anything served &#8220;truffled&#8221; makes me happy. <em> (Do yourself a favor and pick up some black truffle salt; you&#8217;ll thank me later.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Braised Carrot; Beer Battered Miso Tofu, Pea Shoots, Red Wine Chocolate Jus paired with De Ranke XX Bitter</strong></p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/_uAMFh8UrbRo05Q1RmTR_A?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-OSiuBDPXLzE/TfNjyIQijlI/AAAAAAAAAP8/o9yEKF_I0gE/s400/IMG_1464.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Memphis used to have beer battered miso tofu (&#8220;fish &amp; chips&#8221; style) on the menu, but its been ages since I&#8217;ve seen it.  This was an excellent opportunity to remind me of what I was missing.  Personally, I wasn&#8217;t in love with the red wine chocolate jus (I tend to not like combining chocolate with savory foods), but I devoured everything else you see on this plate.  Really enjoyed the XX Bitter as well &#8211; very aggressive hop-wise with a little more than a hint of classic (barnyard-y) brettanomyces.  Dan Shelton described the brett character as &#8220;what Orval <em>used</em> to be like.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Shitake and Leek Dumpling; Mushroom tea, ginger, black pepper oil, charred scallion paired with Mikkeller 10</strong></p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Jo4mZFZmzodSueoUhtaX_w?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-gPtNl0MaMW0/TfNjzcN4vRI/AAAAAAAAAQA/wfWEg-vwzGg/s400/IMG_1465.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">I could eat this soupy dish every day for the rest of my life and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d get sick of it.  All of the flavors here blended quite nicely.  Mikkeller 10 is a followup to their single hop ipa series; in this instance they added 10 different varieties throughout the boil.  Very fruity, a tad bit herbal, all around tasty.</p>
<p><strong>Dessert: Peche Mortel Poached Calimyrn Fig, Toasted Almond, Coffee Caramel, Popcorn Milk, paired with Du Ciel Peche Mo</strong>rtel</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/2XDcDfvAqA_jks1Db3Xo0g?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TavdGLKrr5M/TfNj1FofgUI/AAAAAAAAAQE/dELk-EgZdpQ/s400/IMG_1466.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">Personally, I&#8217;m not a huge fan of figs.  I don&#8217;t dislike figgy flavors in various dishes, or even in some big, complex beers like Belgian strong dark ales, but I don&#8217;t love biting into giant fig chunks.  Nonetheless, I licked this plate clean.  I do wish I asked how exactly &#8220;popcorn milk&#8221; is made, because I certainly want to try it again.  Peche Mortel was a great pairing here; it is one of the best coffee beers in the world (they use fair trade coffee in it, as well.)</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/jdwkym_MKIW4ndxwdJjvoQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1FLq-pAjxKw/TfNj2H2hq9I/AAAAAAAAAQI/a6h-sySYhJY/s400/IMG_1470.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align:center;"><em>Cheers for Chef Jesse Kimball (Phillies hat) &amp; his crew!</em></div>
<p><strong>Cheese Course: Aged Macadamia Cheese, Cashew &amp; Crystal Algae Blue Cheese, pickled blueberries, Smoked Coconut Marmalade paired with Spezial Rauchbier</strong></p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/hAOBTH4f4XUSmlvOZ95ZrA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-g2JXMRO3QYs/TfNj4Z_QDRI/AAAAAAAAAQQ/HTmmBL4RaKY/s400/IMG_1467.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">Even back before I was vegan, I was never a &#8220;cheese person&#8221; &#8211; the type of person to go to a wine party with various fancy cheeses that smell funny.  Semi-recently, though, I ordered <a href="http://www.dr-cow.com/">Dr Cow</a> nut cheese from pangea; it seemed interesting enough to try.  I&#8217;m not sure what happened &#8211; maybe it did not survive the trip from Maryland well, or maybe it sat in my fridge for too long, but it was dreadful.  This sampling (which <em>was</em> from Dr. Cow), on the other hand, was wonderful.  I enjoyed the texture and the taste, and the toasted bread sticks provided for spreading on were perfect.  The smoked coconut marmalade was great&#8230; But we already know Chef Jesse is the master at smoked coconut (see him on <a href="http://dinersdrive-insanddives.blogspot.com/2010/12/from-pork-to-tofu-dv1101h.html" target="_blank">Diners, Drive-ins and Dives</a>.)</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-fVl6VEmPc7s/TfNj3ryib8I/AAAAAAAAAQM/5Zp8U5ODGqk/s400/IMG_1471.jpg" alt="" width="299" height="400" /></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">And finally, no trip to Memphis is complete without using the rest room, and drying your hands with an xlerator &#8211; the only worthy hand dryer in the world.  I&#8217;m trying to figure out how to integrate one of these into my house.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In closing, this event was awesome.  The beer pairings were pretty spot on and the portions were just right. Our table of 5 left very satisfied!  Leigh from Memphis hinted that they will do it again next beer week &#8211; I can&#8217;t wait!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">While the rest of the world is becoming progressively <em><strong>more</strong></em> vegan-friendly, Albany is somehow going in the other direction.  As the <a href="http://blog.timesunion.com/tablehopping/13741/snl-paterson-albany-dining-sucks/">SNL</a> version of our soon-to-be former Governor put it:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;padding-left:30px;">&#8220;&#8230;﻿﻿﻿if you’re in Albany, I can recommend a great place to go for dinner. It’s called Manhattan.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Thankfully, you don&#8217;t even have to go that far. For this <a href="http://veganmofo.wordpress.com/">VeganMofo</a> contribution: a long-overdue review of the only all-vegan restaurant anywhere near Albany, <a href="http://www.woodstockgardencafe.com/">Garden Cafe on the Green</a> in Woodstock, NY.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Visits to Garden Cafe typically follow a day of volunteering at <a href="http://www.woodstocksanctuary.org/">Woodstock Farm Animal Sanctuary</a>. That is, on the days that we don&#8217;t reek of chicken poo! The restaurant is located in the heart of downtown Woodstock and offers an excellent view of the happenings on the Village Green from its garden patio seating.  It&#8217;s open every day, except Tuesday, though I believe the hours change seasonally. Check the <a href="http://www.woodstockgardencafe.com/index.html">website </a>for current hours.</p>
<p>The good news is, Garden Cafe is always busy, serving up cruelty-free, organic meals. The bad news is, Garden Cafe is <em>always</em> busy! No worries, we&#8217;ve never had to wait long (if at all) for a table, especially when the patio is open.</p>
<p>The daily specials rotate, though most &#8220;specials&#8221; are items that can be found on the regular menu as well. The exceptions to this typically are truly exceptional, and a bit pricey (around the $20 range). The menu also allows for cheap, simple eats with make-your-own bowls (using a list of grains, greens and beans/tofu/tempeh) and a variety of delicious sandwiches, salads and quesadillas made with <a href="http://www.daiyafoods.com/">Daiya cheese</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Last weekend, a friend of the spiritual, <a href="http://ny-image3.etsy.com/il_430xN.33042947.jpg">new agey</a> persuasion was in town, so Jaime and I took her down to Woodstock for some groovy shopping and dinner at Garden Cafe. What follows is a description of our meal, which is only a small sample of the goodness Garden Cafe has to offer.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">We started with Warm Walnut Mushroom Pate with Horseradish &#8220;Cream&#8221; Swirl, a rich, nutty paté served with warm homemade whole wheat foccacia. Super delicious, though it needed a touch of salt. Additionally, I had a <a href="http://beernews.org/2009/09/wolavers-alta-gracia-coffee-porter-otter-creek-quercus-vitis-humulus-arrive/">Wolaver&#8217;s Alta Gracia Coffee Porter</a>.  Jaime ordered a vanilla coconut chai and it was delish.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Warm walnut pate" src="http://images2.snapfish.com/232323232%7Ffp538%3A8%3Enu%3D328%3A%3E%3A96%3E%3B%3A6%3EWSNRCG%3D355844%3A39%3A32%3Cnu0mrj" alt="" width="480" height="360" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Next, the main course. We each ordered a dish and rotated clockwise when we had a sample of each.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Dinner at Garden Cafe" src="http://images2.snapfish.com/232323232%7Ffp538%3A9%3Enu%3D328%3A%3E%3A96%3E%3B%3A6%3EWSNRCG%3D355844%3A3%3A232%3Cnu0mrj" alt="" width="360" height="480" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">First up for me, Indian Vegetable &amp; Chickpea Enchiladas with Bombay Sauce. Curried potatoes, chickpeas and a few other veggies, wrapped in a large enchilada (basically a burrito), drizzled with what I believe is a cashew cream sauce and a Bombay curry sauce. This is served with curried apple coconut salad and sautéed kale and onions. which are outstanding. This dish was everyone&#8217;s favorite.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Indian Vegetable &amp; Chickpea Enchiladas with Bombay Sauce" src="http://images5a.snapfish.com/232323232%7Ffp633%3A%3B%3Enu%3D328%3A%3E%3A96%3E%3B%3A6%3EWSNRCG%3D355844%3A39%3B32%3Cnu0mrj" alt="" width="480" height="360" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Next, the old standby: Grilled Curried Tofu Mango Sandwich.  Mango chutney-like sauce on grilled tofu, caramelized onions, roasted red pepper and spiced <a href="http://www.followyourheart.com/product-family.php?id=14">veganaise</a> (spelled the way it is said by every vegan in the universe on the menu) all pressed in toasted whole grain bread and served with small mesclun salad. Need I say more? Reliably fantastic.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Grilled Curried Tofu Mango Sandwich" src="http://images5a.snapfish.com/232323232%7Ffp6339%3A%3Enu%3D328%3A%3E%3A96%3E%3B%3A6%3EWSNRCG%3D355845%3C2%3A432%3Cnu0mrj" alt="" width="480" height="360" /></p>
<p>Moving on to a special, Jerk Tofu Salad. Jerk seasoned tofu over a bed of mesclun, drizzled with Dijon vinaigrette and served with whole wheat foccacia. I have to say, this was the dish I was looking forward to the most and I was a bit disappointed in the amount of jerkyness. While the tofu was tasty, it wasn&#8217;t what I expected. Not bad, especially if you are not into spicy food (which, as we all know, does NOT describe me). I would highly recommend the vegan Caesar over this salad, but it was nice to try something new.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Jerk Tofu Salad" src="http://images5a.snapfish.com/232323232%7Ffp633%3A2%3Enu%3D328%3A%3E%3A96%3E%3B%3A6%3EWSNRCG%3D3558479%3A6832%3Cnu0mrj" alt="" width="480" height="360" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Finally, dessert. Another reliably good treat is the Warm Chocolate Brownie. Rich and chocolatey, and not overly sweet. Covered in warm chocolate sauce and whipped cream. Paired well with my second Alta Gracia!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Chocolate Brownie" src="http://images2.snapfish.com/232323232%7Ffp538%3B5%3Enu%3D328%3A%3E%3A96%3E%3B%3A6%3EWSNRCG%3D355845%3C2%3A732%3Cnu0mrj" alt="" width="480" height="360" /></p>
<p>A fantastic meal, as always. This place is truly one of the best. The only thing I think could be improved upon is the beer list, which has shrunk a bit over the years. Of course, this is a challenge when trying to offer only local and/or organic beers. Anyway, you will always find a decent beer (or wine, if you prefer) to enjoy your delicious meal with.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">If you are anywhere near Woodstock, make the trip out to Garden Cafe and be sure to stop by the little slice of heaven just outside of town, <a href="http://www.woodstocksanctuary.org/">Woodstock Farm Animal Sanctuary</a> (open for tours Saturdays and Sundays, April through October.)</p>

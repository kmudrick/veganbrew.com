										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">I was lucky enough to get an early start with the now coveted <a href="http://www.barthhaasgroup.com/images/html/citra.htm">Citra hop</a>. Immediately after Sierra Nevada released the details of its <a href="http://beernews.org/2008/11/sierra-nevada-to-bottle-first-new-year-round-release-in-over-28-years/">Torpedo Ale</a>, I began a search to find a hop supplier that had any Citras that weren’t sent over to Sierra Nevada. Late in the season, I was able to find some of the 2008 crop through <a href="http://hops2u.com/">Hops2U</a>. I thought the anticipated tropical flavors would work well in a refreshing summer wheat. Additionally, this clean, light-bodied style of beer lends itself nicely to hop experimentation, as it allows the hop character to shine through.  I brewed up a 5 gallon batch of all-Citra wheat, which went incredibly well…up until the final step. During the force-carbonation of the beer in the keezer, one of the quick releases was loose on the keg post. Sadly, by the time I had realized this, the entire batch had emptied into the bottom of my freezer. Smelled like heaven, tasted great, but all went down the drain.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Soon after losing my first beer brewed with Citra, I did make another &#8211; a session pale that also had a nice amount of Simcoe in it (recipe <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/forum/read/2337544#2337693">here</a>). That came out great, but I couldn’t quite tease out the Citra. With the recent flood of Citra hops in the homebrew market, I decided to re-brew the wheat to see what this hop is all about. I had already invested a full day of my time in the previous all-grain batch, so I went with extract on the second attempt to save some time. Here is the recipe:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">5 gallon batch, OG 1.047, FG 1.014, IBU 24,  SRM 5.3</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Malt:<br />
7 lbs <a href="http://www.northernbrewer.com/brewing/brewing-ingredients/malt-extract/malt-syrup/northern-brewer-what-malt-syrup.html">Northern Brewer Wheat LME</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Hops:<br />
.25 oz Citra (11.1% AA) at 60 mins.<br />
.75 oz Citra (11.1% AA) at 10 mins.<br />
1.0 oz Citra (11.1% AA) Dry Hopped</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Yeast:<br />
White Labs WLP320 &#8211; American Hefeweizen Yeast</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Ferment at 65. At the end of primary fermentation, add dry hops. Let it sit on the hops for 5 -7 days, then bottle or keg.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Very simple recipe. Only two ounces of hops, but they packed quite a punch. I feel the flavor is like Amarillo on steroids. Fruity, but not as citrusy as the big &#8220;C hops.&#8221; Definitely more tropical. Huge aroma, also bursting with a fruityness that matches the flavor. I wouldn&#8217;t say passion fruit though, which is what some describe it as. I think more papaya, guava, star fruit, etc. It definitely produces the type of beer you can smell from three feet away.  Even my cat Miso couldn&#8217;t resist!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="CitraWheat &amp; Miso" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm6.static.flickr.com/5253/5479619019_7b527165a2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I also filtered this one, which had a big impact on the appearance and flavor. The American Hefe yeast left a lot of yeast in suspension, which I felt dulled the hop flavor. After removing the yeast, the hop flavor was noticeably sharper. Other than that, I don&#8217;t feel the yeast added anything significant to the beer. I think it&#8217;s safe to say you would have as good or better results with something like Safale US 05 or one of the liquid Cali ale yeasts.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It was a lot of trouble getting to this point, but worth the repeated effort. Overall, this beer is delicious, though, by design, very uni-dimensional. I think the pale ale I brewed with Citra AND Simcoe had a lot more going for it. They complement each other well, much in the same way Amarillo and Simcoe work together. The hop is, without a doubt, a very powerful aroma hop; however, I would advise against something over-the-top, as I think you might end up with fruit punch. More is not always better. Anyway, it&#8217;s an exciting new hop. Get out and try it, if you haven&#8217;t already.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to my awesome brother, I scored a ticket to today&#8217;s Phillies home opener against the Washington Nationals.  Last year, PETA named Citizens Bank Park <a href="http://www.peta.org/mc/NewsItem.asp?id=10114">the most vegetarian-friendly ballpark in North America</a> due to the various veg options.  Vegan <a href="http://www.gardenburger.com/eat-positive/burgers/flame-grilled.php">garden burgers</a>, vegan hot dogs (taste like <a href="http://www.lightlife.com/product_detail.jsp?p=smartdogs">Smart Dogs</a>), and vegetarian cheesesteaks (vegan if you order minus the cheese.)  Well this year they have stepped it up even more &#8211; Planet Hoagie now offers crab-free crab cakes (dissapointingly <a href="http://www.sonatecorporation.com/company.websites/vegadelphiafoods/areas/products/crab.cakes.html">not vegan</a>) and Rick&#8217;s Steaks has added vegetarian chicken cheese steaks (again, vegan minus the cheese.)</p>
<p>Since I did not have a very substantial lunch, I started the game off with a vegan hot dog and gardenburger.  They have these neat onion grinder thingees that you can use to add onions to your food.  You spin a wheel and out comes fresh-diced onions.  Yum.  A perfect accompaniment to both of those items (especially since I personally hate both mustard and ketchup.)</p>
<p>The second best part about the Phils&#8217; stadium?  A stellar beer selection.  Pretty much every local brewery (Sly Fox, Victory, Yards, Troeg&#8217;s&#8230;. Yuengling) are represented on draught, Dogfish Head (Shelter Pale Ale, maybe) can be found in bottles, and the big national craft brews &#8211; Sam Adams and Sierra Nevada, are pouring also.  Good stuff.  All very vegan friendly breweries.</p>
<p>I helped myself to a Victory Hop Devil with my burger &amp; dog, which was an awesome trio.  I later grabbed a Troegs Sunshine Pils (ridiculously refreshing, but probably better suited for those mid summer 90 degree games, for me).  My last beer of the day was somewhat ominous; Yards Philly Pale Ale, probably my favorite local goto beer (deliciously citrus-hop aroma and flavor, reasonable bitterness, light enough to drink lots of) tasted like crap, and it came right around the time that the game imploded for the Phils.  I&#8217;m not sure what the deal is, but of the past 4 Yards Philly Pale pours I have had (4 different locations) &#8211; 2 were delicious, and 2 were dump-worthy.  Today, it tasted kind of like malt vinegar (aceto bacteria) with a splash of moldy bread.  Not pleasant.  Don&#8217;t know who is to blame &#8211; infected tap lines?  Brewing inconsistencies while they continue to contract brew up at <a href="http://lewbryson.blogspot.com/2007/11/major-pennsylvania-brewery-sold.html">The Lion</a> (until the Delaware Ave new brewery opens?)  I don&#8217;t know.  I hope it gets remedied soon!</p>
<p>Side note:  I cracked open a finally carbonated bottle of my <a href="http://www.brew365.com/hops_summit.php">All-Summit Pale Ale</a> that I brewed like 6 or 7 weeks ago and it is freaking delicious.  New. Favorite. Hop.  Between the orangey-citrusy hop flavor &amp; aroma and the subtle fruitiness of the Safale US-05 yeast I used, I think I&#8217;m in love.</p>
<p>Final Score: Nationals 11, Phillies 6&#8230; But at least I ate and drank well!</p>

<p>Anyway, while visiting Albany two weekends ago, I was inspired by the (temporary) break in bad weather. With the first signs of a thawing out, I had summer on the mind and wheat beer in my glass. I&#8217;ve been looking for a way to use up a million-sheet pack of rice paper wrappers I&#8217;ve had for a while. With many filling options on hand, Jaime and I got to work making summer rolls based off of <a href="http://www.veggiebelly.com/2010/08/vietnamese-summer-rolls-mango-sweet-chili-dipping-sauce.html">this</a> recipe. To incorporate the fruit and wheat beer flavors that go so well with everything summer, I came up with a recipe for a fruit and American wheat beer infused dipping sauce.</p>
<p>First,Â  get the dipping sauce together:</p>
<p><strong>Mango and Apricot Wheat Beer Dipping Sauce</strong></p>
<p>1 12 oz bottle apricot wheat beer (I used <a href="http://ithacabeer.com/beers.php#1">Ithaca Apricot Wheat</a>. Dogfish Head <a href="http://www.dogfish.com/brews-spirits/the-brews/seasonal-brews/aprihop.htm">ApriHop</a> would work nicely too)<br />
1/3 cup apple cider vinegar<br />
juice of 1 lemon<br />
1/4 cup agave nectar<br />
1/2 mango, chopped<br />
lemon and orange peel<br />
1/2 teaspoon ginger powder<br />
2-3 dried red chilies</p>
<p>Add everything to a sauce pan. Bring to a boil, lower heat to medium-high and boil for 12 minutes. Remove chilies and puree the mixture. Let cool.</p>
<p>While the sauce is cooling, get started on the rolls. We didn&#8217;t really measure anything and you don&#8217;t have to use what we used. Some basics to have on hand, though: rice paper wrappers, vermicelli noodles (cooked), lettuce,Â  cilantro and thinly sliced carrots. We also added thinly-sliced red pepper, flavored tofu (Soy Boy <a href="http://www.soyboy.com/baked.htm">Tofu Lin</a>) and half of a mango.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Summer roll filling" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm6.static.flickr.com/5144/5646991036_c71bde247d.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Prepare the wraps as Sala at <a href="http://www.veggiebelly.com/2010/08/vietnamese-summer-rolls-mango-sweet-chili-dipping-sauce.html">Veggie Belly</a> suggests. When the dipping sauce has cooled, place the rolls around the sauce and serve with some American wheat and/or fruit beer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Summer Rolls" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm6.static.flickr.com/5148/5646428361_09cd2a389f.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I cannot take any credit for the tightly-wrapped fatties. That was all Jaime. The flavors were super fresh and citrusy. The sauce had a complimentary tropical fruit burst that reminded me of Amarillo hops. Plenty of spice in the sauce, but did not dominate the flavor. Very yummy stuff.Â  For many reasons, looking forward to making these again whenever Spring/Summer finally arrives here in the Northeast.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">I was lucky enough to get an early start with the now coveted <a href="http://www.barthhaasgroup.com/images/html/citra.htm">Citra hop</a>. Immediately after Sierra Nevada released the details of its <a href="http://beernews.org/2008/11/sierra-nevada-to-bottle-first-new-year-round-release-in-over-28-years/">Torpedo Ale</a>, I began a search to find a hop supplier that had any Citras that werenâ€™t sent over to Sierra Nevada. Late in the season, I was able to find some of the 2008 crop through <a href="http://hops2u.com/">Hops2U</a>. I thought the anticipated tropical flavors would work well in a refreshing summer wheat. Additionally, this clean, light-bodied style of beer lends itself nicely to hop experimentation, as it allows the hop character to shine through.Â  I brewed up a 5 gallon batch of all-Citra wheat, which went incredibly wellâ€¦up until the final step. During the force-carbonation of the beer in the keezer, one of the quick releases was loose on the keg post. Sadly, by the time I had realized this, the entire batch had emptied into the bottom of my freezer. Smelled like heaven, tasted great, but all went down the drain.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Soon after losing my first beer brewed with Citra, I did make another &#8211; a session pale that also had a nice amount of Simcoe in it (recipe <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/forum/read/2337544#2337693">here</a>). That came out great, but I couldnâ€™t quite tease out the Citra. With the recent flood of Citra hops in the homebrew market, I decided to re-brew the wheat to see what this hop is all about. I had already invested a full day of my time in the previous all-grain batch, so I went with extract on the second attempt to save some time. Here is the recipe:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">5 gallon batch, OG 1.047, FG 1.014, IBU 24,Â  SRM 5.3</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Malt:<br />
7 lbs <a href="http://www.northernbrewer.com/brewing/brewing-ingredients/malt-extract/malt-syrup/northern-brewer-what-malt-syrup.html">Northern Brewer Wheat LME</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Hops:<br />
.25 oz Citra (11.1% AA) at 60 mins.<br />
.75 oz Citra (11.1% AA) at 10 mins.<br />
1.0 oz Citra (11.1% AA) Dry Hopped</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Yeast:<br />
White Labs WLP320 &#8211; American Hefeweizen Yeast</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Ferment at 65. At the end of primary fermentation, add dry hops. Let it sit on the hops for 5 -7 days, then bottle or keg.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Very simple recipe. Only two ounces of hops, but they packed quite a punch. I feel the flavor is like Amarillo on steroids. Fruity, but not as citrusy as the big &#8220;C hops.&#8221; Definitely more tropical. Huge aroma, also bursting with a fruityness that matches the flavor. I wouldn&#8217;t say passion fruit though, which is what some describe it as. I think more papaya, guava, star fruit, etc. It definitely produces the type of beer you can smell from three feet away.Â  Even my cat Miso couldn&#8217;t resist!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="CitraWheat &amp; Miso" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm6.static.flickr.com/5253/5479619019_7b527165a2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I also filtered this one, which had a big impact on the appearance and flavor. The American Hefe yeast left a lot of yeast in suspension, which I felt dulled the hop flavor. After removing the yeast, the hop flavor was noticeably sharper. Other than that, I don&#8217;t feel the yeast added anything significant to the beer. I think it&#8217;s safe to say you would have as good or better results with something like Safale US 05 or one of the liquid Cali ale yeasts.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It was a lot of trouble getting to this point, but worth the repeated effort. Overall, this beer is delicious, though, by design, very uni-dimensional. I think the pale ale I brewed with Citra AND Simcoe had a lot more going for it. They complement each other well, much in the same way Amarillo and Simcoe work together. The hop is, without a doubt, a very powerful aroma hop; however, I would advise against something over-the-top, as I think you might end up with fruit punch. More is not always better. Anyway, it&#8217;s an exciting new hop. Get out and try it, if you haven&#8217;t already.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">After mentioning my plans to brew a pumpkin barleywine to some friends, they generously gave me a pair of pumpkins from their garden. Unfortunately, I never got around to brewing the barleywine. Instead, the pumpkins were used as decorations for Halloween. A few days after Halloween, I noticed that one of the pumpkins was starting to rot. Rather than see them both go to waste, I decided I needed to do something with the remaining pumpkin. I haven&#8217;t had the time to brew lately, so I decided to use the pumpkin in a bread recipe.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Pumpkin" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4154/5176071264_659617969d_z.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="384" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Last fall, I brewed a pumpkin porter and added roasted pecans to the secondary. The beer turned out great, I think. The roasty, chocolate flavors of the porter went nicely with the nutty flavors of the pecans and the velvet texture of the pumpkin. With that beer in mind, I came up with the following pumpkin bread recipe, which uses a homebrewed porter (similar to <a href="https://veganbrew.com/2009/03/16/smoked-porter/">this one</a>, but without the smoked malt) as an ingredient in the bread and in a sweet, maple glaze.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Pumpkin Bread Ingredients:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">2 cups sugar<br />
1 cup vegetable oil<br />
2 tablespoons <a href="http://www.ener-g.com/gluten-free/egg-substitute.html">Ener-G Egg Replacer</a><br />
1/2 c water<br />
16 ounces pumpkin (canned or fresh)<br />
3 1/2 cups flour<br />
2 teaspoons salt<br />
2 teaspoons baking soda<br />
1 teaspoon baking powder<br />
1 teaspoon nutmeg<br />
1 teaspoon allspice<br />
1 teaspoon cinnamon<br />
1/2 teaspoon cloves<br />
2/3 cup porter</p>
<p>Porter-maple glaze</p>
<p>2 teaspoons <a href="http://www.earthbalancenatural.com/">Earth Balance</a><br />
3/4 c porter<br />
1/4 c maple syrup<br />
1 tablespoon sugar<br />
pecan pieces, toasted (optional)</p>
<p>If you are using fresh pumpkin, begin by cutting off the top of the pumpkin, remove the &#8220;guts,&#8221; then cut the flesh of the pumpkin into 1&#8243; cubes, removing the skin as you do this. Place the chunks into a steamer basket and steam for about 25 minutes until the pumpkin is soft.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Pumpkin puree" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4144/5175466391_28efd72a3a_z.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="384" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Preheat the oven to 350. When the pumpkin is ready, puree with a hand blender or food processor and set aside. Mix the oil and sugar together in a bowl. Add the egg replacer to the water and mix well, then mix this into the sugar mixture along with the pumpkin puree.  In a separate bowl, mix the dry ingredients together. Blend the porter and sugar mixture into the dry ingredients, making sure to get all of the lumps out (obviously, a mixer would help with this.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Pumpkin bread batter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4089/5175467287_cf02f4839a_z.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="384" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Divide the mixture in half and place into two, well greased and floured 9 x 5 bread pans. Bake for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. When the bread is done, let cool while you get started on the glaze.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">To make the glaze, heat the Earth Balance in a sauce pan.  Add the beer, sugar and maple syrup to the pan and bring the mixture to a boil. Turn down the heat and allow most of the liquid to boil off, stirring often. The idea here is to get the malted barley sweetness from the beer, as well as some caramelization of the sugar. The glaze should be thick, but runny enough to coat the bread.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Porter Maple Glaze" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4107/5176074536_0f94983474_z.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="288" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Do not allow this to cool. With a pastry brush, coat the loaves of bread immediately. Let the glaze cool and harden on the bread.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Pumpkin Bread wtih Porter Maple Glaze" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4127/5176072072_cb30afa507_z.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="288" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I think topping this with crushed, toasted paeans would be the perfect final touch. Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t have any on hand and Jaime is not into baked goods that have nuts in them, so I didn&#8217;t bother running to the store to get some. Anyway, this came out really well. The bread is very moist and fluffy, not overly sweet and has some nice caramelized sugar flavors from the glaze. The spices are delicious &#8211;  pumpkin pie spice without being too aggressive. A great way to use up some Halloween pumpkins!</p>

<p>Hi, it&#8217;s Jaime here with my first VeganBrew guest post.  I&#8217;m usually lurking behind the scenes as a taster/editor/amateur food stylist, but I was inspired to come out from the shadows when I saw <a href="http://www.timesunion.com/default/article/Odd-combinations-make-Sonoran-dog-work-1365150.php">this AP article</a> in my local Albany rag.  Brett and Kevin have been falling down on the job, so I figured I&#8217;d jump in.  I don&#8217;t know why the AP wrote this story, but maybe in the aftermath of the royal wedding and Osama&#8217;s demise, there&#8217;s no news left to report in the world.  Anyway, I was simultaneously grossed out and fascinated by concept of a bacon-wrapped hot dog in a soft bun with a million toppings.  I decided it had to be veganized, and would make a perfect Cinco de Mayo-themed post for VeganBrew, paired with my favorite cerveza Mexicana, Negra Modelo.  Here are some of the basics I started with:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Sonoran Hot Dog ingredients" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3076/5701663814_e7742727c9.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>Ingredients</p>
<p>4 veggie dogs<br />
4 slices of veggie bacon (I recommend Lightlife Smart Bacon)<br />
4 bolillo rolls or sub rolls<br />
1 can black or pinto beans<br />
1/2 t Adobo seasoning<br />
1 jar salsa<br />
1 container <a href="http://www.wayfarefoods.com/content/products">Wayfare Cheddar Sauce</a> or vegan queso of your choice<br />
1 jar sliced jalapenos<br />
1 tomato<br />
1 onion<br />
2 T cilantro<a href="http://www.followyourheart.com/products.php?id=3"><br />
veganaise</a><br />
yellow mustard</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Let me start by saying that many of these ingredients were not my first choice.  First, I went to my local Mexican market in the hopes of scoring authentic pan bolillo, but I struck out.  I had a fleeting thought of making the bolillo from scratch, but quickly realized that was not happening.  So a pack of sub rolls would just have to do.  The trick, however, was in steaming them.  Just a minute or so in the steamer basket on the stovetop transformed mere sub rolls into a moist, delicious base for fake-meaty goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The next strikeout was in the bacon department.  My intention was to use Lightlife Smart Bacon, but our local co-op was out, so I was left to choose between Yves Veggie Canadian Bacon and Lightlife &#8220;Fakin Bacon.&#8221;  I was concerned that the Fakin Bacon wouldn&#8217;t be flexible enough to wrap around the dog without breaking, and I was also afraid it would be too tempeh-ish, so I opted for the Canadian Bacon.  It wrapped great, but the flavor didn&#8217;t quite stand out once the whole behemoth came together.  I&#8217;ll definitely use the Smart Bacon next time.  Finally, <a href="http://www.soyboy.com/about.htm">SoyBoy</a> Not Dogs are mediocre at best, but SoyBoy is the bomb when it comes to their bulk tofu, which is the firmest and freshest around, plus they&#8217;re kind of local being from Rochester and all, so we&#8217;re brand loyal.  What can I say?</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Anyway, on to construction:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Sonoean Hot Dogs Grilled" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm3.static.flickr.com/2095/5701686404_5020d1a1d3.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:left;">I soaked a couple of skewers while I diced tomatoes, jalapenos and onions and Brett fired up the grill.  Then, when it came time to do the bacon wrapping, I discovered that Brett had &#8220;helped out&#8221; by throwing away the sticks in the cup that he thought were garbage.  While soaking the skewers a second time, I heated a can of organic black beans in a skillet with 1 T chopped jalapenos, 2 T salsa, and about a half t. of Adobo, my all-time favorite seasoning.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">When I couldn&#8217;t wait any longer for the skewers to soak (after about 8 minutes) I wrapped the bacon around the dogs, secured it with a skewer, and brushed each dog with a generous coating of olive oil, taking care to keep the oil off the skewers.  After a quick 5 minutes on the grill, flipped halfway through, the dogs were ready to be blanketed in a sea of toppings.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Starting with the buns fresh out of the steamer basket, I split each one open and removed some of the inner bread to create a little cavern, which I ladled some of the beans into.  Then I added a dog, some salsa, Wayfare Cheddar Sauce, chopped tomatoes, onions and jalapenos, Veganaise, yellow mustard, and chopped cilantro.  Here&#8217;s what it looked like all assembled and ready to be conquered like the French in the Battle of Puebla.  (Sorry &#8212; obligatory Cinco de Mayo reference)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Sonoran Hot Dog" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm3.static.flickr.com/2013/5701094365_0fcb033cc9.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The results were muy delicioso.  I was initially concerned that the mustard would clash terribly with the other toppings, but I was wrong.  Everything melded, with each bite highlighting a different part of the mix.  The Negra Modelo complemented the dog perfectly.  My only complaint, as I mentioned earlier in the post, was that the veggie Canadian bacon wasn&#8217;t bacony enough to stand out in the crowd, so I definitely recommend using Smart Bacon.  If you try it, please post and let me know how it turns out!</p>

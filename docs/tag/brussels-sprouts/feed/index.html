										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">On more than one occasion, when I&#8217;ve told people about this blog I&#8217;ve been asked: &#8220;have you heard about John Schlimm&#8217;s upcoming book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tipsy-Vegan-Boozy-Recipes-Every/dp/0738215074/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1321935533&amp;sr=8-1">The Tipsy Vegan</a>?&#8221; <a href="http://johnschlimm.com/">John Schlimm</a> is the author of 11 books, including The Ultimate Beer Lovers Cookbook, and is a member of one of the oldest brewing families in America, <a href="http://www.straubbeer.com/">Straub Brewery</a> in Saint Marys, Pennsylvania. Needless to say John&#8217;s latest bookÂ  on cooking vegan with booze was right up my alley and I was stoked when we were generously provided a pre-release copy to review (many thanks to Lara at<a href="http://www.perseusbooksgroup.com/dacapo/home.jsp"> Da Capo Press</a>).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Tipsy Vegan" src="https://i0.wp.com/webesharin.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/The-Tipsy-Vegan.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="312" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The book itself is very well designed: filled with colorful pictures and well organized. The sections of the book are not only broken down by recipe type (e.g., The Guzzler&#8217;s Garden of Side Dishes), but also by the type of booze you want to cook with. Recipes using everything from amaretto to whiskey are indexed at the beginning of the book, making it easy to find the beer recipes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I had hoped to make a wide variety of dishes before this release-day review, but only had time for one dinner. Let me be clear, though, the recipes couldn&#8217;t be much easier&#8230;it was my &#8220;research&#8221; of things boozy that has kept me from cooking &amp; writing. The fact that the recipes use simple ingredients and are very easy to make are a big plus for people who don&#8217;t want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen. Also, unlike so many vegan recipe books and blogs that center on meat analogues, there is an obvious focus on vegetables, something I really appreciate.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Tonight I made Blitzed Brussels Sprouts Moutarade, sprouts cooked in a cognac-infused mustard sauce, and Bottom&#8217;s Up VegeBean Stew, a hearty bean and vegetable stew cooked in beer broth. All was served over quinoa (not the first time you&#8217;ve seen these ingredients <a href="https://veganbrew.com/2010/11/30/beer-braised-brussels-sprouts-with-shiitake-bacon-quinoa-pilaf/">together</a> on VeganBrew).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The Brussels sprouts were easy to make and very tasty! I&#8217;ve never cooked with &#8216;yack before, but absolutely love it. The oak and fruit from the cognac are nicely balanced with the strong flavors of mustard and lemon.Â  The slight bitterness of the Brussels sprouts add another layer of goodness. Big fan of this recipe.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Blizted Sprouts" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm7.staticflickr.com/6035/6381032069_c348fb7318.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="360" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The vegetable and bean stew calls for 12 oz of beer of your choice, with the suggestion of either light lager (for cool, summer stew) or a dark beer (for a fall/winter warmer). John also encourages adding homebrew or spices to make the beer unique each time. I did take his advice, using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Applewood-Bacon-Salt-2-5-Ounce-Bottles/dp/B00247ATFS">applewood smoked &#8220;bacon salt&#8221;</a> (thanks Kev), fava beans in place of lima beans and homebrewed dry stout for the beer (more on this beer later.) Definitely a tasty meal, though I probably should have cooked the stew as long as the recipe instructed (2.5 &#8211; 3 hours) to get the full flavor experience. No doubt, the perfect recipe for a slow cooker!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm7.staticflickr.com/6101/6381036867_ba2b16c244.jpg" alt="" width="263" height="350" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">My only complaint about the book would be that I expected more beer recipes &#8211;Â  more like a veganized version ofÂ The Ultimate Beer Lovers Cookbook. Nonetheless, my first experience with The Tipsy Vegan is a success and I look forward to making other recipes. I&#8217;ve already bought the ingredients for the Lentils in the Fast Lane and The Boozer&#8217;s Smoky-Spicy Baked Beans. This is a great cookbook that would make for a fun gift for the vegan boozer in your life. Get yours today!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Onto the last entry for <a href="http://veganmofo.wordpress.com/">Vegan Mofo</a>. It&#8217;s been a lot of fun and definitely a motivator for Kev and I to keep the blog updated. We&#8217;ll try not to let the momentum die off, keeping these updates coming often.</p>
<p>Recently a vegetarian friend of mine, who has been on a long quest for a good alternative to bacon, passed on a recipe for shiitake mushroom &#8220;bacon&#8221; that she had picked up from a graduate from the <a href="http://www.naturalgourmetschool.com/">Natural Gourmet Institute. </a>I was a bit skeptical when she told me it only involved salt, olive oil and shiitakes. No liquid smoke?? Well, after a quick search on the google I found <a href="http://www.sciencentral.com/video/2009/03/02/make-mushrooms-taste-like-bacon/">this</a> recipe and instructional video from a chef at the Natural Gourmet Institute. Perfect. I made the bacon, following the instructions on the site. I had to cook a bit longer (about an hour) and could have actually gone a bit longer, as the crispier pieces came out more bacon like. Here are the shiitakes before and after baconizing:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Shiitake Bacon" src="http://images5a.snapfish.com/232323232%7Ffp63387%3Enu%3D328%3A%3E%3A96%3E%3B%3A6%3EWSNRCG%3D357232675%3A32%3Cnu0mrj" alt="" width="371" height="480" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I wouldn&#8217;t say you are going to fool an omnivore with this recipe, but no doubt, the &#8220;bacon&#8221; has an awesome salty and savory flavor, with a greasy touch that makes for a good substitute. There&#8217;s even a bit of smokeyness in the pieces that got a little blackened. Extremely flavorful and relatively simple.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I had some Brussels sprouts leftover from the <a href="https://veganbrew.com/2010/11/04/veganized-vlaamse-stoofkarbonaden-belgian-beef-stew/">harvest</a> that I had stored in the freezer, which seemed like a good match for the bacon. I also had a bottle of <a href="http://www.leffe.com/en/beer/leffe-blond">Leffe Blond</a> in the fridge (purchased with a friend on a 4 am drunken stroll through Manhattan last weekend, after closing <a href="http://www.gingerman-ny.com/">The Ginger Man</a>), so I decided to braise the thawed sprouts in 1/2 cup of Leffe Blond for about 10 minutes (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_sprout#Cooking_and_preparation">avoid overcooking</a>), then sprinkled them with some smoked salt and smoked black pepper.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Beer Braised Brussels Sprouts" src="http://images2.snapfish.com/232323232%7Ffp538%3A9%3Enu%3D328%3A%3E%3A96%3E%3B%3A6%3EWSNRCG%3D356%3B%3C%3A727%3A32%3Cnu0mrj" alt="" width="480" height="360" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Most of the beer was absorbed by the sprouts, which gave them a caramelized sweetness. This sweetness complimented the salty &#8220;bacon&#8221; perfectly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Brussels Sprouts and Shiitake Bacon" src="http://images5a.snapfish.com/232323232%7Ffp6338%3B%3Enu%3D328%3A%3E%3A96%3E%3B%3A6%3EWSNRCG%3D356%3B%3C%3A728332%3Cnu0mrj" alt="" width="360" height="480" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">To round out the meal, I decided to make quinoa. I chose quinoa mostly because it acted as the protein for the dish, but also because I&#8217;ve been meaning to try to make it in my <a href="http://www.zojirushi.com/ourproducts/ricecookers/np_hbc.html">Zojirushi rice cooker</a>. I&#8217;ve read that quinoa can be made in it exactly as you would make white rice. I set it to medium hard white rice and it was ready &#8211; evenly cooked and delicious &#8211; in about 20 minutes. To add a bit more flavor, I made a pilaf with the cooked quinoa.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">To make the pilaf, toast 1/2 cup of sliced almonds (I used almonds that were coated with maple and cayenne) and set aside. Then, saute 2-3 cloves of crushed garlic in 1/4 cup of olive oil. Add 3 cups cooked quinoa. Stir for a few minutes, then add 1 teaspoon of fresh thyme and 1 tablespoon of cumin. Mix in the almonds and 1/4 cup of raisins or currants. Finally, mix in 1 tablespoon <a href="http://www.bragg.com/products/la.html">Bragg&#8217;s liquid aminos</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Shiitake Bacon Brussels Sprouts and Qunioa Pilaf" src="http://images5a.snapfish.com/232323232%7Ffp63389%3Enu%3D328%3A%3E%3A96%3E%3B%3A6%3EWSNRCG%3D356%3B%3C%3A6%3A6332%3Cnu0mrj" alt="" width="360" height="480" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This was relatively easy to make and was bursting with flavor. Sweet, salty, savory and even a touch of spice from the cayenne coating on the almonds. All this went well with the peppery flavors in the Leffe. I will definitely be making this one again soon!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">On to day 4 of <a href="http://veganmofo.wordpress.com/">Vegan Mofo</a>&#8230;.Belgian &#8220;beef&#8221; stew.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Last weekend, my wife and I harvested the first batch of Brussels sprouts from our community garden plot. In a very corny way, we felt somewhat proud carrying the stalk of sprouts back to our house. It was essentially the vegan version of bagging a buck. Seriously, look at this beauty!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Brusselsprouts" src="http://images5a.snapfish.com/232323232%7Ffp633%3B3%3Enu%3D328%3A%3E%3A96%3E%3B%3A6%3EWSNRCG%3D355639%3B84732%3Cnu0mrj" alt="" width="480" height="360" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">When we got our prize back to the kitchen, we immediately got to work &#8220;dressing&#8221; it, removing all of the leaves (de-stemmed, chopped, and stored in the freezer to be used like collard greens) and pulling the little sprouts from the stalk.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="brusselsprouts2" src="http://images5a.snapfish.com/232323232%7Ffp63393%3Enu%3D328%3A%3E%3A96%3E%3B%3A6%3EWSNRCG%3D355638%3C45832%3Cnu0mrj" alt="" width="480" height="360" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Like most people, I grew up thinking Brussels sprouts were the most disgusting thing ever created. Later in life I gave them another chance, as a vegetable among others being roasted. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I thoroughly enjoyed them and, having learned a bit more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_sprout#Cooking_and_preparation">proper preparation</a>, have come to like them in many forms.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Appropriately I wanted to make something Belgian with these sprouts of Brussels. In the past, I&#8217;ve made a few attempts at a veganized Flemish beef stew called Vlaamse Stoofkarbonaden. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_cuisine#Typical_dishes">Wikipedia</a> describes this as &#8220;a Flemish beef stew, similar to the French Beef Bourguignon, but made with beer instead of red wine.&#8221; I&#8217;ve tried to veganize a few recipes I&#8217;ve found online, subbing beef with seitan. They&#8217;ve come out OK, but the traditional recipes aren&#8217;t much more than broth and meat. I decided I&#8217;d make a new, modified version that had a healthy dose of hearty root vegetables and, of course, Brussels sprouts. To bring out the rich flavors of the vegetables, I roasted them before adding to the stew. Before preparing the vegetables, however, you&#8217;ll want to get started on the &#8220;beef.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beefy Seitan Roast:</p>
<p>Wet ingredients:</p>
<p>1 c water<br />
2 cloves of garlic, minced<br />
2 T olive oil<br />
1 T tomato paste<br />
1 T <a href="http://www.wanjashan.com/include/N3O2.htm">Wan Ja Shan oyster mushroom sauce</a><br />
1 T <a href="http://www.anniesnaturals.com/organic_bbq#jump204">vegan Worcestershire sauce</a><br />
1 T almond butter<br />
1/2 t <a href="http://www.superiortouch.com/btb.htm">Organic Better than Bouillon Vegetable Base</a><br />
1/4 t liquid smoke</p>
<p>Dry ingredients:</p>
<p>1 1/2 c vital wheat gluten<br />
1/4 c nutritional yeast<br />
1 T smoked paprika</p>
<p>Cooking broth</p>
<p>1 large white onion, coarsely chopped<br />
1 large carrot, coarsely chopped<br />
2 c vegetarian &#8220;beef&#8221; broth (I used about 2 T of dried broth in 2 cups of water)<br />
2 T balsamic vinegar ( I think an acidic Flemish red like <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/48/10482">Monk&#8217;s</a> would work nicely for this too)<br />
2 T tomato paste<br />
1 T Bragg&#8217;s Liquid Aminos<br />
1 T dried thyme<br />
1 T dried marjoram<br />
1/2 t liquid smoke<br />
1 bay leaf</p>
<p>Mix all of the wet ingredients for the seitan together and blend until smooth. Mix together the dry ingredients, then add the wet to form a ball. It should be firm, but not too firm. A little mushy, but not sticking to your hands. Heat a little oil in a cast iron Dutch oven, then cook the seitan a few minutes on each side, just enough to lightly brown. Set aside.</p>
<p>To make the cooking broth, heat a little more oil in the Dutch oven, then saute the onion for about 15 minutes. Add the carrots and cook for 5 more minutes. Add the remaining ingredients for the cooking broth and bring to a boil. Transfer the seitan back into the broth, reduce heat to the point where the broth is barely bubbling. Partially cover the Dutch oven. Cook for 1.5 hours, flipping the seitan every 30 minutes.</p>
<p>While the seitan is cooking, start roasting some vegetables. I used beets, rutabaga, turnips, carrots, sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts and a head of garlic. Feel free to changes this, based on your preferences. Chop the roots into chunks, place everything into an oiled baking pan, toss with some more olive oil, lots of black pepper and a few dashes of smoked paprika. Place in the oven at 450 for about 45 minutes, or until the roots are soft. Be careful not to burn the sprouts!</p>

<p>Stew sauce:</p>
<p>2 c dark Belgian beer (I used <a href="http://www.ommegang.com/index.php?mcat=1&amp;scat=2">Ommegang Abbey Ale</a>)<br />
2 t molasses<br />
2 t apple cider vinegar<br />
2 t dried mustard powder<br />
1 t salt<br />
1 t black pepper</p>
<p>Once the seitan is ready, remove from the Dutch oven and let it cool. Meanwhile, mix together the ingredients from the stew sauce, add to the remaining broth, onions and carrots in the Dutch oven and blend until liquefied. Bring the stew sauce to a boil and cook for about 10 minutes. As it cooks, the alcohol will cook off and the aroma will become more pleasant. Cut the beef into large chunks (about 1&#8243;) and add to the stew sauce, along with about 2-3 cups of the roasted vegetables. Cook for a few more minutes, then serve with a nice Belgian strong dark ale.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">I paired this dish with a 2.5 year-old bottle of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delirium_Nocturnum">Delirium Nocturnum</a> from my cellar, which complimented the meal perfectly. A very rich and hearty stew, with a sweet dark fruit and burnt sugar flavor.Â  Lots of earthy, slightly bitter flavors came through with the roasted vegetables, that went nicely with the sweetness of the molasses and beer.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I should point out that the recipes you will find for this stew often say to add a slice of bread with mustard on it to the meat (odd I know). Anyway, with all of the starchy vegetables, I didn&#8217;t feel it needed the bread as a binder. I did add some mustard powder to the stew sauce to get those flavors, though.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I think the modified version came out great, with much more going on than the others I&#8217;ve made. Give I try &#8211; it&#8217;s worth the effort.</p>

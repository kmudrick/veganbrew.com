										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another <a href="http://www.veganmofo.com/">VeganMofo</a>, is here. That&#8217;s cool and all, but I have to say every time I read &#8220;vegan mo-fo&#8221; I think of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8cw1sYG-mg">Vegan Muthafucka</a>, which is just fucking weird.</p>
<p>Anyway, a week in with no posts, we&#8217;re off to a bad start! The first few days of October both Kevin and I were outside of Portsmouth, New Hampshire running the <a href="http://www.hamptonrockfest.com/">Smuttynose Brewing Co. Rockfest Marathon</a> mentioned in the previous <a href="https://veganbrew.com/2011/08/28/smuttynose-promo-to-benefit-woodstock-farm-animal-sanctuary/">post</a> (still time left to<a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/runforthebulls/fundraiser/brettwyker"> donate</a> to the<a href="http://woodstocksanctuary.org/"> Woodstock Farm Animal Sanctuary</a> fundraiser!) The race was pretty horrible for both of us. We each had an illness or injury and the cold, driving rain destroyed any hope of overcoming it. It was quite a challenge, but we both pushed through, crossing the finish line with rather disappointing times. On the bright side, we got to sample some vegan food and beer in and around Portsmouth, which made the experience slightly less painful.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smuttynose.com/">Smuttynose Brewing Company</a>, who sponsored the race, and its sister brew pub, <a href="http://www.portsmouthbrewery.com/">Portsmouth Brewery</a>, are the dominating craft breweries in the area. As you may know, Portsmouth Brewery is creator of the infamous <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMiZ5whKTuk&amp;noredirect=1">Kate the Great</a>, Russian Imperial Stout. Definitely an awesome beer, but there are so many other great beers poured at the brewery and some stellar vegan options on the menu to boot! We hit up the brew pub the night before and after the race. We had the carb-heavy Smoked Tofu with Rice Noodles, an enormous portion of stir fried noodles, loads of veggies and <a href="http://www.soyboy.com/baked.htm">Tofu Lin</a> style smoked, pressed tofu.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Smoked Tofu" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6239/6218703263_125c148284_z.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="335" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">There is also a tempeh wrap on the <a href="http://www.portsmouthbrewery.com/portsmouth_brewery_menus/our_menu.html">menu</a>, as well as the usual pub food offerings of hummus and a veggie burger. Note, we did not get a straight answer on whether the Brewery Veggie Burger is vegan. While the ingredients seem straight forward &#8211; a blend of tofu, toasted oats, roasted fresh vegetables and spice &#8211; when I asked, I was told dismissively &#8220;no it&#8217;s not vegan, it&#8217;s got some stuff in the burger.&#8221; Probably worth asking again.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">There beers were excellent! Very good timing on our part, as the wet-hop-brewed Hop Harvest II was on tap, which <a href="http://badassbeer.wordpress.com/2011/09/30/smuttynose-portsmouth-brewery-e-mail-3/">appears</a> to be brewed with fresh <a href="https://veganbrew.com/2010/08/02/citrawheat/">Citra</a> hops. This beer is truly outstanding &#8211; definitely one of the best wet-hop beers I&#8217;ve ever had. Huge fresh hop aroma, lots of tropical fruit flavor. Incredible. I&#8217;m not a big <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/style/16">Gose</a> fan, but Portsmouth is one of the few pubs where you&#8217;ll find one brewed and we were also lucky to be there while it was on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Portsmouth Pints" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6156/6218833051_f9d462933f_z.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="335" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Also worth mentioning, there is an all vegan raw restaurant called <a href="http://www.revitalivecafe.com/">Revitalive Cafe</a> just south inÂ Newburyport, Massachusetts.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="revitalive cafe" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6114/6219366050_19ca2b2786_z.jpg" alt="" width="422" height="316" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I didn&#8217;t really enjoy my raw &#8220;tuna&#8221; wrap so much, but Kevin and Jaime liked their dishes, including the Taco Salad, Raw Vegan Pizza and the Revita-Wrap (shown below).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Revita wrap" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6214/6218846117_9c66efd2f8.jpg" alt="" width="410" height="307" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Finally, I would not leave Portsmouth without an organic vegan pizza cooked in a wood-fire oven at the <a href="http://flatbreadcompany.com/">Flatbread</a> in downtown Portsmouth.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Flatbread" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6218/6219392414_c661488b1c_z.jpg" alt="" width="422" height="316" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Delicious artisan flatbread pizza with all the fixing and a good number of decent beers. SO good!!</p>

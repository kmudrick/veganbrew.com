										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the beginning of veganbrew, the pioneering effort of two vegan<br />
beer geeks to bring together the inventive worlds of vegan cuisine and<br />
craft beer. What does veganism and beer have to do with each other you<br />
ask? Perhaps it&#8217;s best summed up by honest Abe:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a firm believer in the people. If given the truth, they can be<br />
depended upon to meet any national crisis. The great point is to bring<br />
them the real facts, and beer.&#8221;</p>
<p>â€“ Abraham Lincoln</p>
<p>It is every genuine craft beer crusader&#8217;s mission to school the masses on<br />
the wonderfulness of craft beer in the hopes that they will wean<br />
themselves off of the carbonated piss served up by Budweiser, Miller and<br />
Coors. So why stop at what we drink? In an effort to wean the masses off<br />
of the garbage served up by KFC, McDonald&#8217;s and Burger King, we will<br />
regularly fill these pages with commentary on the whys and how-tos of<br />
eating and preparing delicious vegan food, while enjoying fine craft beer.</p>
<p>Make no mistake about it, the core of our mission is centered on social<br />
responsibility.  The industrial model used for <a href="http://www.farmsanctuary.org/issues/factoryfarming/">modern-day farming</a> is<br />
flat-out reckless and immoral. However, let us be perfectly clear on this<br />
&#8211; we are not dumpster-diving, politically correct, granola hippies.<br />
Likewise, we are not self-important, &#8220;my shit doesn&#8217;t stink because I<br />
donate to Green Peace,&#8221; pseudo-environmentalists.  On this blog you won&#8217;t<br />
find rants about the war in Iraq, genocide in Darfur or how wrong it is to<br />
&#8220;water board&#8221; someone. The world is a fucked up place, but that, my<br />
friend, is why we drink so much! What you will find is reviews of vegan<br />
fare served up at brew pubs around the country, recipes for cooking with<br />
beer, socially responsible homebrewing, write ups of beer and vegan food<br />
pairing, vegan-friendly breweries, and much more.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

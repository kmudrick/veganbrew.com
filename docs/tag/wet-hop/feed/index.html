										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another <a href="http://www.veganmofo.com/">VeganMofo</a>, is here. That&#8217;s cool and all, but I have to say every time I read &#8220;vegan mo-fo&#8221; I think of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8cw1sYG-mg">Vegan Muthafucka</a>, which is just fucking weird.</p>
<p>Anyway, a week in with no posts, we&#8217;re off to a bad start! The first few days of October both Kevin and I were outside of Portsmouth, New Hampshire running the <a href="http://www.hamptonrockfest.com/">Smuttynose Brewing Co. Rockfest Marathon</a> mentioned in the previous <a href="https://veganbrew.com/2011/08/28/smuttynose-promo-to-benefit-woodstock-farm-animal-sanctuary/">post</a> (still time left to<a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/runforthebulls/fundraiser/brettwyker"> donate</a> to the<a href="http://woodstocksanctuary.org/"> Woodstock Farm Animal Sanctuary</a> fundraiser!) The race was pretty horrible for both of us. We each had an illness or injury and the cold, driving rain destroyed any hope of overcoming it. It was quite a challenge, but we both pushed through, crossing the finish line with rather disappointing times. On the bright side, we got to sample some vegan food and beer in and around Portsmouth, which made the experience slightly less painful.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smuttynose.com/">Smuttynose Brewing Company</a>, who sponsored the race, and its sister brew pub, <a href="http://www.portsmouthbrewery.com/">Portsmouth Brewery</a>, are the dominating craft breweries in the area. As you may know, Portsmouth Brewery is creator of the infamous <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMiZ5whKTuk&amp;noredirect=1">Kate the Great</a>, Russian Imperial Stout. Definitely an awesome beer, but there are so many other great beers poured at the brewery and some stellar vegan options on the menu to boot! We hit up the brew pub the night before and after the race. We had the carb-heavy Smoked Tofu with Rice Noodles, an enormous portion of stir fried noodles, loads of veggies and <a href="http://www.soyboy.com/baked.htm">Tofu Lin</a> style smoked, pressed tofu.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Smoked Tofu" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6239/6218703263_125c148284_z.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="335" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">There is also a tempeh wrap on the <a href="http://www.portsmouthbrewery.com/portsmouth_brewery_menus/our_menu.html">menu</a>, as well as the usual pub food offerings of hummus and a veggie burger. Note, we did not get a straight answer on whether the Brewery Veggie Burger is vegan. While the ingredients seem straight forward &#8211; a blend of tofu, toasted oats, roasted fresh vegetables and spice &#8211; when I asked, I was told dismissively &#8220;no it&#8217;s not vegan, it&#8217;s got some stuff in the burger.&#8221; Probably worth asking again.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">There beers were excellent! Very good timing on our part, as the wet-hop-brewed Hop Harvest II was on tap, which <a href="http://badassbeer.wordpress.com/2011/09/30/smuttynose-portsmouth-brewery-e-mail-3/">appears</a> to be brewed with fresh <a href="https://veganbrew.com/2010/08/02/citrawheat/">Citra</a> hops. This beer is truly outstanding &#8211; definitely one of the best wet-hop beers I&#8217;ve ever had. Huge fresh hop aroma, lots of tropical fruit flavor. Incredible. I&#8217;m not a big <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/style/16">Gose</a> fan, but Portsmouth is one of the few pubs where you&#8217;ll find one brewed and we were also lucky to be there while it was on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Portsmouth Pints" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6156/6218833051_f9d462933f_z.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="335" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Also worth mentioning, there is an all vegan raw restaurant called <a href="http://www.revitalivecafe.com/">Revitalive Cafe</a> just south in Newburyport, Massachusetts.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="revitalive cafe" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6114/6219366050_19ca2b2786_z.jpg" alt="" width="422" height="316" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I didn&#8217;t really enjoy my raw &#8220;tuna&#8221; wrap so much, but Kevin and Jaime liked their dishes, including the Taco Salad, Raw Vegan Pizza and the Revita-Wrap (shown below).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Revita wrap" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6214/6218846117_9c66efd2f8.jpg" alt="" width="410" height="307" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Finally, I would not leave Portsmouth without an organic vegan pizza cooked in a wood-fire oven at the <a href="http://flatbreadcompany.com/">Flatbread</a> in downtown Portsmouth.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Flatbread" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6218/6219392414_c661488b1c_z.jpg" alt="" width="422" height="316" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Delicious artisan flatbread pizza with all the fixing and a good number of decent beers. SO good!!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The warm, sunny days we had in the Northeast this summer resulted in very happy hop plants. I&#8217;ve picked several pounds of crystal, centennial and chinook hops from the plants in my <a href="http://www.cdcg.org/">community garden</a> and have a fair amount of nugget waiting to be picked.  Without a doubt the best year yet, both in terms of quantity and quality. Now the challenge will be using them up!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="hops" src="http://images5a.snapfish.com/232323232%7Ffp633%3A3%3Enu%3D328%3A%3E%3A96%3E%3B%3A6%3EWSNRCG%3D34%3C69935%3A432%3Cnu0mrj" alt="" width="323" height="432" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Before I picked and dried the hops, I decided I would  make another attempt at a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/21/dining/21hops.html">wet hop/fresh hop</a> beer with the freshly picked chinooks and crystals. Commercial examples of wet hop beers have been popping up over the years, but since they can only be brewed this time of year and take a significant amount of hops that have to be used very quickly, it&#8217;s not too often that you will find one on tap at your local pub. Like most things related to hops (and craft beer in general),<a href="http://www.sierranevada.com/"> Sierra Nevada</a> is the originator of the style. Without a doubt, the best I&#8217;ve had is the <a href="http://thefullpint.com/beer-news/inside-look-at-sierra-nevada-estate-homegrown-ale">Estate Ale</a> &#8211; made with organically grown hops and barley grown at the brewery. Taking a few tips from an interview with Brewmaster Steve Dresler on the <a href="http://thebrewingnetwork.com/shows/660">Brewing Network</a> &#8211; including the 5 to 1 ratio of wet to dry hops &#8211; I came up with the following recipe. I only used the wet hops, picked about an hour before brewing, for the late additions in the kettle. I stuffed them into cheesecloth sacks and used some stainless steel washers to weigh them down (like <a href="http://images2.snapfish.com/232323232%7Ffp538%3B3%3Enu%3D328%3A%3E%3A96%3E%3B%3A6%3EWSNRCG%3D34%3C69935%3A732%3Cnu0mrj">this</a>), which is quite the challenge with so many whole leaf hops. Also, I realize I used a fairly dark crystal malt (120L), which is unusual for an IPA. It was the only organic crystal malt I had on hand. I used just a touch for coloring, which I think worked out fine.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">5 gallon extract batch with specialty grains:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">OG: 1.055 FG: 1.017 SRM: 6.2 IBU: (roughly 50??)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Grains:<br />
6 lbs. Briess organic DME<br />
.22 lbs. organic crystal 120L<br />
.60 lbs. organic cane sugar</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Hops:<br />
1 oz dried organic whole leaf Centennial (~8.5% AA) at 60 mins.<br />
12.5 oz wet/fresh organic whole leaf Chinook (~10.5% AA) at 15 mins.<br />
6.25 oz wet/fresh organic whole leaf Chinook (~10.5% AA) at 0 mins.<br />
3 oz  wet/fresh organic whole leaf Crystal (~3.5% AA) at 0 mins.<br />
1 oz dried organic Chinook (~10.5% AA) dry hop<br />
1 oz dried organic Crystal (~3.5% AA) dry hop</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Yeast:<br />
Fermentis US-05 Cali Ale</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Place the crystal malt in a grain sack and steep in 6.5 gallons of 150 degree water for approximately 20 minutes. Bring the water up to 170, remove the grains, then bring water to a boil. Turn off the heat, add the DME and sugar, then return to heat. When wort reaches a boil, begin adding hops as indicated above. When the boil is complete, transfer 5 gallons to the fermenter and chill to 65 , pitch yeast, ferment at 68 for about one week. At this point I added half of the dry hops for a week, filtered, then added the other half of the dry hops to the keg after it carbonated. Alternatively, you can just add all of the dry hops and condition for another week or two.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="wethop ipa" src="http://images2.snapfish.com/232323232%7Ffp538%3B2%3Enu%3D328%3A%3E%3A96%3E%3B%3A6%3EWSNRCG%3D354745%3B2%3A332%3Cnu0mrj" alt="" width="480" height="360" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I think this was about as fresh as it comes. Bursting with &#8220;chewy&#8221; (like biting into a hop cone, without the bitterness) wet hop flavor and aroma. I feel it was in large part due to the chinooks, which were dripping with oil when they came off of the vine. Chinooks are rarely considered for more than bittering in recipe formulation and I think that is a mistake, especially when you want a fresh, citrusy flavor and aroma. They pack quite a punch and the crystals give the beer a subtle, yet very nice earthy/floral touch. I was very happy with the results and received a lot of positive feedback from friends; however, it did not place in the<a href="http://www.breworganic.com/Competition/index.html"> National Organic Brewing Challenge</a>. Still waiting for the score sheets &#8211; I&#8217;ll update with judge comments when I get them. Regardless, I loved the beer and kicked the keg in just a few days (sharing with friends, of course). Can&#8217;t wait to brew again next year.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Update:</strong> Scored a 31 in the Organic Brewing Challenge. Not too bad I guess, considering the third place winner for the category (Specialty Beer, Category 23) scored a 34. The judges comments were generally favorable, with the only flaw being that it wasn&#8217;t bitter enough for an IPA. I would definitely agree with that. Nowadays, I tend to brew hoppy beers with the focus being more on the flavor and aroma hops than on the bittering hops. Also, in the case of homegrown hops, it&#8217;s difficult to get the IBUs down during the recipe formulation. Anyway, one judge mentioned that if the beer were entered as an American Pale Ale, it would have done far better. I&#8217;ll give it a shot as an APA in the <a href="http://www.thoroughbrews.org/kbotb/index.html">Knickerbocker Battle of the Brews</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by the amazing <a href="http://www.tofurky.com/tofurkyproducts/sausages.html">Tofurky Beer Brats</a>, I have been on a quest to create a good homemade brat using <a href="../2009/12/30/beer-battered-seitan/">Isa&#8217;s method</a> for making sausages. It took a few attempts to get the spices right, but I think the recipe that follows is pretty solid. I&#8217;ve even had a few meat eaters tell me the brats are tasty. Previous attempts were  over spiced (particularly with caraway) or too fluffy from over carbonated beer. It&#8217;s best to use small amounts of the stronger spices and flat or lightly carbonated beer. Also, in the process I learned fat is key. Although I don&#8217;t have any desire to replicate meat grossness, a meat analogue recipe without lots of fat  would be like a cake recipe without sugar. What&#8217;s the point? Don&#8217;t be afraid of the oil and Earth Balance. I actually think this recipe could be improved with a little more of each.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hop harvest time, so I went with a beer brewed with wet hops &#8211; fresh from the vine, no drying, right into the kettle. There are several good wet hopped beers out there, but I went with one I find to be exceptionally tasty, <a href="http://www.southerntierbrewing.com/beers.html">Southern Tier Harvest</a>. As a wet-hopped <a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style08.php#1c">ESB</a> the &#8220;grassy&#8221; freshness of the hops are front and center, without the harsher bitterness of an IPA. This works well when cooking with beer.  More about wet hop beers soon, as I have one of my own fermenting right now.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting, I&#8217;ve also found German weizen beers (e.g.,<a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/31/82"> Pinkus Hefeweizen</a>) and hoppy beers that aren&#8217;t very bitter  (e.g., <a href="http://www.troegs.com/our_brews/pale_ale.aspx">Troegs Pale Al</a>e) work well.  Just be sure to let the beer sit out for a while to flatten. Anyway, onto the recipe.</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<p>1/2 cup cooked brown/green lentils<br />
1 cup wet hop beer, flat (optional: reserve a few ounces of the bottle to braise greens)<br />
3 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil<br />
2 tablespoons<a href="http://www.bragg.com/products/la.html"> Bragg&#8217;s Liquid Aminos</a> (or tamari)<br />
1/4 teaspoon liquid smoke<br />
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme<br />
1/2 teaspoon mustard powder<br />
1/4 teaspoon allspice<br />
1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika<br />
1/4 teaspoon caraway seeds<br />
1 1/4 cup vital wheat gluten<br />
1/4 cup nutritional yeast<br />
2 tablespoon melted <a href="http://www.earthbalancenatural.com/">Earth Balance</a></p>
<p>Blend the lentils, beer, oil, Bragg&#8217;s, liquid smoke and spices together until the lentils are near liquefied. In a separate bowl, mix together the gluten and the nutritional yeast. Mix the wet and the dry ingredients together to form a firm ball. Tear into 6 even pieces, mold into about 4&#8243; long sausages and wrap each in aluminum foil, tightly twisting the ends. Steam for 40 minutes. When the sausages have finished steaming, unwrap and coat in the melted Earth Balance, then grill for a few minutes on each side.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Beer Brats" src="http://images5a.snapfish.com/232323232%7Ffp63393%3Enu%3D328%3A%3E%3A96%3E%3B%3A6%3EWSNRCG%3D34%3C7%3C%3B9%3A8732%3Cnu0mrj" alt="" width="360" height="480" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I served this batch with some kale harvested from our garden (braised with a few ounces of the beer) and some grilled corn from our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-supported_agriculture">CSA</a>. Also, poured a Dijon mustard-nutritional yeast sauce over the brats (B-12 Tamari Dijon sauce from the <a href="http://www.betterworldbooks.com/book-id-0609809814.aspx">Candle Cafe</a> cookbook). Everything paired wonderfully with the beer. Hearty, yet full of flavor from the recently-harvested ingredients. It was Labor Day when I made this meal and it felt appropriate for the unofficial end of summer.</p>

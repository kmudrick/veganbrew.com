										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">A while ago I noticed <a href="http://www.stonebrew.com/about_us/staff/photo_of_the_month/index.html">this</a> (scroll down to Oct 2004): <a href="http://twitter.com/Leechase">Lee Chase</a>, vegan and former brewmaster at <a href="http://www.stonebrew.com/">Stone Brewing Co</a>., preparing a Chana Masala dish with <a href="http://www.stonebrew.com/ipa/">Stone IPA</a>. India Pale Ale as an ingredient in an Indian dish &#8211; this seems like a perfect match. Through personal experience and <a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-241-Beer-Examiner~y2009m11d12-Beer-and-chili-enthusiasts-debate-Does-hoppy-beer-intensify-chili-heat?cid=exrss-Beer-Examiner">some research</a> I&#8217;ve found that hoppy beers intensify the heat in spicy foods, which works very well for me as Indian cuisine is my absolute favorite and I&#8217;m a self-proclaimed &#8220;hop head.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I decided to get creative with the chana. Instead of using store bought curry powder or pre-mixed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garam_masala">garam masala</a>, I made my own spice mix. It was mostly based off of a recipe I found in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flavors-India-Vegetarian-Indian-Cuisine/dp/1570670234/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1263666537&amp;sr=1-1">Flavors of India</a>. I changed a few of the ingredients, but I still found this to be much more authentic than any store-bought stuff (especially better than the stuff from the supermarket &#8211; seriously, how many Indians do you know named <a href="http://www.mccormick.com/Products/Herbs-and-Spices/Spices-A-to-Z/Curry-Powder.aspx">McCormick</a> ??) So, the first step in this recipe is to make the garam masala. I suggest doing so, but if you don&#8217;t feel it&#8217;s worth the trouble, at least try to get your pre-mixed garam masala from a local Indian grocery store.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Making the garam masala mix:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The most time-consuming part of this entire recipe is getting the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardamom">cardamom</a> seeds out of the pods. A huge pain in the ass, but trust me, you do not want to bite into the pod. Often, Indian restaurants leave the seeds in the pods, which is a very unpleasant surprise. It tastes like poison. You can speed things up using a good  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortar_and_pestle">mortar and pestle</a>. Crush a small handful of pods, then dig out the seeds from the crushed shells. After that, the rest is simple.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="    aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="cardamom" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm6.static.flickr.com/5172/5482194951_718ca883d2.jpg" alt="Getting to the cardamom seeds" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Garam masala spice mix:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">1/8 cup cardamom seeds<br />
1/8 cup whole cloves<br />
1 teaspoon coriander seeds<br />
1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns<br />
1/2 teaspoon white peppercorns<br />
1 piece star anise, broken into pieces (or 1/2 tsp. fennel seeds)<br />
1 teaspoon cumin powder (or 2 tsp. seeds)<br />
2 teaspoons cinnamon</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Toast everything but the cinnamon in heavy frying pan (I used a cast iron dutch oven) until the spices begin to smoke (10-15 minutes), stirring frequently.  You can also roast them in an oven at 200 for about 15 minutes. When toasted, add to a coffee grinder with the cinnamon and crush into a powder. If you don&#8217;t have a coffee grinder, you can use a mortar and pestle.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Making the Chana Masala</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">4 (or more) dried red chillies<br />
1 tablespoon black mustard seeds<br />
2-3 tablespoons <a href="http://www.earthbalancenatural.com/">Earth Balance</a><br />
1 onion, chopped<br />
2-3 cloves of garlic, crushed<br />
1/2 teaspoon diced ginger<br />
1 tablespoon garam masala<br />
2 teaspoons cumin powder<br />
1/2 teaspoon turmeric<br />
4 cups cooked chickpeas<br />
2 cups crushed tomatoes<br />
1 teaspoon soy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecithin">lecithin</a><br />
2 teaspoons salt<br />
1/2 cup IPA or Double IPA<br />
1/2 onion, chopped and cilantro for garnish</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Toast the mustard seeds and chilies in a heavy pan (I used the same dutch oven I toasted the garam masala spices in). When the seeds start to pop, remove and set aside. Add 2 tablespoons of Earth Balance to the pan and saute the onions and garlic for 5 minutes.  Add the ginger, cumin, garam masala, turmeric, mustard seeds, chilies and chickpeas (note: I soaked mine over night and cooked in the pressure cooker, but I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s about two cans worth). Stir to coat the onions and chickpeas in the spices. Cook for a few minutes, then add tomatoes, another tablespoon of Earth Balance (optional), lecithin (for a buttery flavor) and salt. Cook until the tomato liquid is nearly gone &#8211; about 20 minutes. Add in the beer and cook for another 5-10 minutes. Serve with rice (I used organic <a href="http://www.zojirushi.com/servicesupport/faq/faq_ricecooker.html#q16">gaba brown</a> basmati &#8211; excellent!) Garnish with the chopped onions (this is not an optional step! The raw onions make it so much better) and cilantro.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="     aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Simcoe Chana" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm6.static.flickr.com/5176/5482194959_6c64e7174a.jpg" alt="Adding Double Simcoe to Chana" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I used a bottle of the unfiltered version of Weyerbacher&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/weyerbacher-unfiltered-double-simcoe-ipa/103546/">Double Simcoe</a>. I&#8217;m a huge fan of the regular Double Simcoe and had picked up a 750ml bottle of the special release a few days before making the chana. I expected it to be a perfect hop-bomb, but have to say I was very disappointed. The beer is way too carbonated and the hops seems significantly muted by the loads of yeast in the bottle. More hop bitterness than floral/citrus hop flavors. Nonetheless, I&#8217;ve read that high carbonation and bitterness are two of the main factors in the hop-spice reaction. I felt the chana got an extra kick from the beer, but I think standard Double SImoce or a nice regular IPA like <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/147/88">Stone&#8217;s</a>, <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/3818/9088">Southern Tier &#8216;s, </a>or <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/450/1481">Yard&#8217;</a>s IPA would have been far superior.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Anyway, the chana was great. My best attempt at Indian food so far. I think the trick is lots of spice and oil, to the point where you begin to question whether you&#8217;re overdoing it. Also, I&#8217;ve been burned a few times at Indian restaurants when I learn there is &#8220;a little bit of dairy&#8221; in something. The Earth Balance and lecithin give it that you&#8217;ve-been-lied-to flavor you come to expect. The spices paired very will with the unfiltered Double SImcoe, but don&#8217;t be afraid to add even more heat or more hops. I think this recipe is far from the limit in both respects. Enjoy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Spring has come early this year and my hops have noticed. I have four hop plants going strong in our <a href="http://www.cdcg.org/">community garden</a> plot. The Chinook and Centennials are going into their fourth year and it&#8217;s the third year for the Crystal and Nugget hops.</p>
<p><img style="border:.5px solid black;" title="Hops shoots" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm6.static.flickr.com/5137/5479652111_5eeda50835.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I am especially excited to see the hops coming up early, as I have been looking forward to cooking up some hop shoots. After learning that hop shoots are eaten as a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/kent/4558643.stm">Belgian/French delicacy</a> (known as <a href="http://www.oikostreecrops.com/store/product.asp?cookiecheck=yes&amp;P_ID=703&amp;PT_ID=133&amp;strPageHistory=cat">Jets de Houblon</a>), I wanted to try to use them in the <a href="http://www.veganyumyum.com">veganyumyum</a> recipe for <a href="http://veganyumyum.com/2009/04/pan-fried-gnocchi-with-morels-and-fiddleheads/">pan-friend gnocchi with morels and fiddleheads.</a> It&#8217;s a recipe I&#8217;ve made a few times and love, though in the off-season I have to substitute the fiddleheads with asparagus (and I&#8217;ve never made it with the morels, unfortunately.) The hop shoots are a prefect early-spring substitute for the fiddleheads and the recipe provided me with an excuse to cut back the hops while I get the trellis set up.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I followed the recipe as it is on veganyumyum, with a few additions/substitutions. I added some garlic and organic kalamata olives and gave it a splash of about 2tsps of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truffle_oil"> white truffle oil</a> at the end. Also, I subbed the morels with a mix of organic shiitake, shimeji, abalone and &#8220;field&#8221; mushrooms (10 oz frozen bag from Wildwood Farms.) Finally, I used about 20 6&#8243; hop shoots in place of the fiddleheads. I prepared the hop shoots in a separate pan, blanching them in about 1/4 cup of <a href="https://veganbrew.com/2010/03/27/biere-de-mars/">Biere de Mars</a> for about 5 minutes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:.5px solid black;" title="hop shoots frying" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm6.static.flickr.com/5299/5479652121_4d7cb9762b.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">When the hop shoots were softened, I set them over the other ingredients in a bowl. I also pan-fried some asparagus to mix with the remaining gnocchi. It turned out to be a very tasty meal. Though I don&#8217;t think the hop shoots had a tremendous impact on the flavors, they did add an interesting touch &#8211; a mix of asparagus and the &#8220;wild&#8221; flavors and crunchy texture of fiddleheads.  They had a slight bitterness (probably offset some with the sweetness of the beer), yet overall their flavor was somewhat subtle. Each ingredient added an interesting dimension and came together as a nicely balanced, highly enjoyable dish.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">It was a perfect meal for a beautiful spring evening. It was enjoyed outside, paired with a very nice brett-infused saison from The Bruery, <a href="http://www.thebruery.com/beers/index.html">Saison Rue</a>.  The &#8220;wild&#8221; flavors of the funky farmhouse ale went incredibly well with the food and the 80 degree weather. Indeed, a delicious start to spring.</p>

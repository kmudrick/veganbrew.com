					<description><![CDATA[Haha, I personally don&#039;t see a problem with this at all.. but I&#039;m more or less sure the lady of the house wouldn&#039;t see it that way.  Maybe I&#039;ll have to explain how much wonderful beer we could produce and try to persuade her :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know much about home brewing and its processes, but I enjoy how you read up/learn about the history of the beer before trying your own take on them.  Love the updates and can&#039;t wait to have room someday to start home brewing as well. Keep it up!]]></description>

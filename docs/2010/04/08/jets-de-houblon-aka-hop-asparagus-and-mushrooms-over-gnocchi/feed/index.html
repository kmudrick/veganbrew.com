					<description><![CDATA[Pretty sure Trader Joe&#039;s sells vegan gnocchi.

Also, I am finding black truffle salt to be easier to use than either black or white truffle oil. Seems more stable - I find that while truffle oil in particular seems to lose its aroma pretty quickly if there is any amount of cooking happening.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll have to check when I get home from workâ€¦ I thought I had a recipe on the blog but not sure if I ever posted it.

This was one of the first times I made it, but I switched back to boiling to potatoes instead of baking and mashing them when still warm rather than cold :)

I bought the gnocchi at the grocery store. It&#039;s with the dried pasta, etc. Definitely vegan, but it does have some preservatives and crap. Would you mind sharing your recipe for the real stuff?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These are so easy. Also, many ways to change the flavor and texture. I usually add the ones listed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://veganbrew.com/2009/04/05/hickory-smoked-seitan-steaks-in-a-porter-bourbon-demi-glace/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; recipe, which are mostly from Kevin&#039;s experiments. I&#039;ve also been using blended shiitake stems in the wet ingredients a lot and, last night, made some with shiitake stems, blended soy curls and quinoa flakes (came out great!). Also, replace the water with coconut milk and add jerk seasoning to the dry ingredients for jerk seitan. Lots of possibilities. Great base for other recipes or good on their own. Nice work Kev.]]></description>

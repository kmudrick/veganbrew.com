					<description><![CDATA[Ha, thanks for the compliments on the Brussels sprouts :) Procrastination and neglect are the secrets to good gardening! We got the starts (cheating, I know) in the ground a little late and just let them do their thing. Added a little mushroom compost and trimmed off the bottom leaves late in the season too. I think it was just luck. The people in the next plot over also had tiny sprouts and they practically live in the garden!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Those Brussels sprouts!
:faints:

I&#039;ve been growing mine from seed since February, and my sprouts are about the size of dimes -- totally pitiful.  Yours are absolutely beautiful!
This looks like a really delicious recipe -- love the idea of putting oyster mushroom sauce in the wet ingredients of seitan.  Definitely bookmarked to try later, maybe when my sprouts finally grow up!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[this place looks great. better than any vegan-friendly pubs we have in LA. most of our options are salad (with the exception of tony&#039;s, but there it&#039;s pretty much JUST sausages). i would kill for a craft beer with some vegan mashed potatoes.

i&#039;m adding this to the list of places to visit someday.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Eric: happy hour at Khyber is 4-6 7 days a week, $2 off all drafts, and pitcher specials. This week it&#039;s great lakes Edmund Fitzgerald porter for $10. Domestic bottles and other drinks are a buck off.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mm this looks great! I totally hear you on having consumed your portion of portobello mushrooms for life already, I feel the same way. Here in SF it&#039;s a wild mix... some places are really good with vegan options, others are total misses... kind of surprising, actually, how many resist pubs putting vegan options on the menu. Well, if you guys are around my neck of the wood, drop me a note and we go have a few pints in my favorite places! (I&#039;m just getting back into home brewing after a long hiatus.. love this blog!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not sure about Memphis&#039; desserts.  I do remember them offering some stuff from North Port Fishington or whatever that company was called, when they first opened.  I feel like the last time I was there they mentioned at least one of the desserts was vegan - but again, I tend to over-eat on the apps &#038; entree and rarely make room for cake &#038; cookies :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a 10 minute walk from here and I haven&#039;t been yet. It sounds really delicious, especially the mashed potatoes and gravy, which is something I rarely have unless I make it myself. I will get over there this weekend.

Do you happen to know if Memphis Taproom still has vegan desserts?]]></description>
